         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>Chriſtian Reader,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IF thou haſt an affection for <hi>London,</hi> or any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular concern in the rebuilding of it, (as very many have) the title of this book (and I will aſſure thee the drift and purport of it, is ſuch as the Title pretendeth to) may invite thee to ſpend a few hours in the peruſal of it, and to cover a multitude of infirmities in the Author, and this his work, with reſpect to the goodneſs, and uſefulneſs of his deſign. I know no ſecular deſign now on foot, in this part of the world, that is, or ſeemeth to be, of greater importance, and that to thouſands of families, than is the rebuilding of <hi>London:</hi> and yet no one Engliſh pen (ſo far as I know) hath been imployed, in the directing, and incouraging of it, till the unworthy Author of this poor Treatiſe, like <hi>Elihu</hi> who had waited for the words of others, and did not anſwer to <hi>Job,</hi> till his betters ſeemed reſolved to be ſilent, made bold to break the Ice, and did redeem what time he could, from a thouſand cares, and perplexities, to ſignifie his great compaſſion, and high reſpects to that once famous, but now ruinous City, in which he drew his firſt breath. I dare not to ſpeak in any ſuch language as <hi>Deborah</hi> did, <hi>Judg.</hi> 5.7. <hi>They ceaſed in Iſrael, till I Deborah aroſe, &amp;c.</hi> I ſhall not preſume to compare with her, though but a woman, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther confeſs my ſelf to be as <hi>a worm and no man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What the Apoſtle ſaith of himſelf, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.3. <hi>I was with you in weakneſs, and in fear, and in much trembling,</hi> and the expreſſions he uſeth concerning
<pb facs="tcp:45718:4"/>himſelf, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.19. <hi>Serving the Lord with all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility of mind, and with many tears, and temptations which befel me:</hi> I ſay thoſe expreſſions have been much what applicable to my caſe (as they that have known my circumſtances do underſtand,) I have been at the moſt, but a <hi>bruiſed reed, and ſmoking flax,</hi> (let the world judg of me as it pleaſeth) yet have I broke through all diſtractions, and diſcouragements (which have even laid me level with the City, or that part of it which lieth in aſhes) to do what ſervice, I could for the place of my nativity, to blot out the name of <hi>Icabod,</hi> and to retrieve, and recall that glory of <hi>England</hi> which for the preſent is departed.</p>
            <p>Yet let me not affright my reader, by what I have ſaid, with the expectation of a <hi>melancholy</hi> peice, upon ſo joyful a ſubject, as is the reſtauration of <hi>London,</hi> for in treating thereof, I have rather com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported with the nature, and quality of the ſubject, which is pleaſant, and chearily, than with the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion of my own mind, and thoſe ſad, and dolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous reſentments of things, (both my own and others) which I have too much converſed with. One had wont to ſay that <hi>he did love to drink his wine with his friends, but to eat his vinegar by himſelf</hi> (mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to impart his joyes, rather than his ſorrows) and as to that I am much of his mind. I will rather hang my harp upon the willowes, than play thoſe doleful tunes to others, which I do ſometimes liſten to my ſelf.</p>
            <p>What if now and then, I ſay within my ſelf that the age we live in, is an unkind and an ill-natured age? that <hi>all men</hi> now adaies do <hi>ſeek their own things, and not the things of others,</hi> that <hi>intereſt</hi> carrieth all before it, and whatſoever is worthy, and far more worthy than it ſelf, ſignifieth nothing in
<pb facs="tcp:45718:4"/>compariſon of it, ſo that they who are too honeſt to comply, with this or that intereſt, farther than they underſtand it to comport with religion, and reaſon, ſhall have leave to ſtarve, whilſt they who boggle at nothing, that is in purſuance of that <hi>inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt</hi> they have fallen in with, but follow it (as if in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt were the lamb ſpoken of, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.4.) whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therſoever it goeth, though that their diſhoneſt ſelf-love (for ſo it is) be all they have to commend them, ſhall ride upon the high places of the earth, and have more than heart can wiſh.</p>
            <p>I may ſometimes think of it with regret, that perſons in no authority at all, do uſually take upon them to preſcribe, and give law to others, in thoſe things, in and as to which they ſhould only be a law to themſelves, I mean left to their own judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and conſciences: and ſo it is that they who command the purſe, do ſeem to think that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences of men ſhould be in ſubjection to them, themſelves aſſuming, or challenging that power of impoſing, and <hi>that dominion over the faith of</hi> other men, (though really their equals) which they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn in others, who are legally their ſuperiours.</p>
            <p>It goeth near to me ſometimes to think how full of ſnares, and temptations, the preſent time is, both on the right hand, and on the left, as if all the Devils in Hell were not tempters enough, nor the wiles and methods of Satan ſufficient to try us, or as if to grapple <hi>not only with fleſh and blood, but alſo with principalities and powers, and ſpiritual wickedneſſes in high places, and with the rulers of the darkneſs of this world,</hi> were not as much as one of us could well turn our hands to, unleſs men turned Divels too (tempters I mean) and went about like roaring Lions ſeeking whom they could devour. I freely confeſs I have had many black and gloomy thoughts
<pb facs="tcp:45718:5"/>upon the conſideration of thoſe things, ſuch as if others had been conſcious to, they might have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected I ſhould have done like the <hi>madman</hi> ſpoken of <hi>Prov.</hi> 26.18. <hi>viz. have</hi> caſt about <hi>firebrands, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes and death,</hi> but inſtead thereof, I have been pleaſant with my reader, (at ſeveral turnes,) yea oftner ſo, than ſowr and melancholy; though there be ſomething of both kinds, wherewith to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain thoſe that are of different humours. I have fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently <hi>piped to thoſe</hi> that have a mind to <hi>dance</hi> (allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.17.) and elſewhere <hi>mourned unto them that are more diſpoſed to lament:</hi> as having been under various tempers my ſelf, whilſt I was about this work, and found that ſaying of a reverend Divine moſt true, that <hi>one man in a little time is many men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In ſome parts and places of this book, thou mayeſt <hi>lye down</hi> (as it were) <hi>in green paſtures,</hi> and <hi>be lead beſide the ſtill waters</hi> (alluding to <hi>Pſ.</hi> 23.) I mean tollerably recreate thy ſelf, if thou haſt a mind ſo to do: and in others again, as in dark groves, and obſcure grottoes, thou mayeſt ſatiate thy ſelf with melancholy, if that humour pleaſe thee better (as ſome have ſeemed to me, to be in love with it) But I think thou wilt find the daies longer than the nights, and leſs of darkneſs than of light, or lightſomneſs, throughout this whole treatiſe, which I had no mind to make like the Fiſh called <hi>Sepia,</hi> or <hi>Cuttle-fiſh,</hi> which caſts ink, and blackneſs, upon all the waters where it ſwims (at leaſt-wiſe ſo often as it ſelf is in any trouble, or danger of being taken) but rather more like that more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent creature, <hi>viz.</hi> the Sun, which diſperſeth clouds and darkneſs, whereſoever he cometh <hi>(Sic liceat magnis componere parva)</hi> that is, if it be lawful for us to make ſo unequal a compariſon.)</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:45718:5"/>
            <p>There are two things which I ſhould moſt of all deſire to meet with in the preface to any book, <hi>viz.</hi> Some account of the Authour, either from himſelf, or from ſome other, and ſome account of the work. I would know whoſe book I read, I mean the <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi> and temper of the Authour, that I might the better underſtand what I read; <hi>ex. gr.</hi> If I know the <hi>Canticles</hi> to have been indited by the holy Ghoſt, and penned by <hi>Solomon,</hi> I am ſure no one expreſſion in that whole book, ought to have any wanton or laſcivious conſtruction put upon it: nor could be ſo intended (the Authour conſidered) though but for that, there are ſeveral paſſages in that book, liable enough unto being taken in an amorous ſenſe. It is an ordinary ſaying <hi>Cum duo faciunt idem non eſt idem,</hi> when two men, (<hi>viz.</hi> of different ſpirits do one thing, it is not one, and the ſame thing which they do. The ſame may be applied to writing, and ſpeaking. Thoſe paſſages may be well taken from perſons of known, moderation, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from others, might be liable to a worſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, and the ſayings of moderate men ſhould always be taken in a modeſt, and moderate ſenſe, (if the words will but bear it) and whereas it is ſaid <hi>that every thing hath two handles, viz.</hi> a better and a worſe, what is preſented to us by perſons uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally owned, as candid, and moderate, ſhould always be taken by the better handle of the two, for the ſayings and writings of men, are generally ſuch as they themſelves are.</p>
            <p>Now the Authour of this Treatiſe, knowing that a verbal teſtimony, given by any man to himſelf, doth ſignifie nothing, as Chriſt ſaith, <hi>If I bear record of myſelf, my record is not true</hi>) maketh his humble appeal to all that know him, whether the tenour of his converſation, and practice (for profeſſions and
<pb facs="tcp:45718:6"/>ſubſcriptions amount to little) hath not alwaies pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed him a moderate man, of <hi>a reconciling ſpirit,</hi> and of <hi>a healing temper.</hi> Thoſe countries that lie near the equinoctial line, are continually ſcorched with heat, (whether the Sun be moving north or ſouth) whereas thoſe parts which are more remote from the Ecliptick line, (or path of the Sun) go by the name of temperate <hi>zones:</hi> So have I ſeen ſober perſons, who by virtue of their moderation, have been nearer to others (whether they were ſuch as had <hi>Northern,</hi> or <hi>Southern</hi> latitude) for mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration is a kind of <hi>(medium participationis)</hi> a partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of two extreams, but of neither of them in extremity (like a compoſition of elements which remain in mixtion but refractly) I ſay I have ſeen ſuch under greater ſufferings than other men, who have been violent, one way or other, and to fare like one that goes about to part a couple that are fighting, and by that means brings them both about his own ears, and whilſt he would make them friends with one another, makes them both ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to himſelf. I was about to ſay, I my ſelf have been a kind of <hi>Martyr</hi> in the behalf of <hi>Moderation,</hi> and am not aſhamed to own it. It is fit that ſome body ſhould do the world good, even againſt its will, and particularly by promoting that which vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence would certainly extinguiſh, I mean <hi>love</hi> and <hi>reconciliation,</hi> without which the world can no more be happy, than there can be day in the world with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Sun.</p>
            <p>If I have any moderation to ſpare, as ſome think I have) I wiſh I could impart it to them that have little or none. <hi>God was not in the wind, which rent the mountains, nor in the earth quake, nor in the fire, but in the ſtill ſmall voice,</hi> 1 Kings 19.12. All the four Evangeliſts do record that the holy Ghoſt deſcended
<pb facs="tcp:45718:6"/>like a dove, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.16, &amp;c. <hi>The wrath of man ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſheth not the righteouſneſs of God.</hi> I profeſs my ſelf to be neither for <hi>Paul,</hi> nor for <hi>Apollos,</hi> nor <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phas</hi> in oppoſition to one another, but for Chriſt in conjunction with all of them, and to be moſt for thoſe Diſciples whether of <hi>Paul,</hi> of <hi>Apollos,</hi> or of <hi>Cephas</hi> which I judg to be really beſt in their practice, though more remote than others from my particular judgment.</p>
            <p>So far as men are of my mind, they bear my image, but ſo far as they are good they bear Gods image: now I would love Gods image in men, more than my own. It may be a mans defect to be like me, but I am ſure it is his excellency to be like God. I cannot bring my ſelf to think that all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of one, or two perſwaſions are only godly, and that all the reſt of people who are not of thoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions, are carnal, and wicked: I think that ſome perſwaſions have fewer people of good lives, adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to them, than do adhere to ſome others, but yet there are ſome worſe people amongſt thoſe that are generally beſt, and ſome better people than many of them, amongſt thoſe that are generally worſe than they, and that I ought to love the good people, of a party more generally bad, better than the bad people of a party that is more generally good. Time was that <hi>Judas</hi> might have been ſeen amongſt the diſciples of Chriſt, and Chriſt himſelf amongſt the publicans.</p>
            <p>Grace and Learning (or ſolid wiſdom) and good nature, all, yea every one of theſe, do more attract my heart to him that hath them, and is not of my judgment, than to be of my judgment, doth, or can attract it, to him that hath them not. If I were a Presbyterian indowed with power (as ſome of that name have ſomtimes been) I would more love and
<pb facs="tcp:45718:7"/>encourage an Epiſcopal man, that were of good life and of good Learning, and of a peaceable ſpirit than one that profeſſed himſelf a zealous Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian, whoſe life, and learning, and temper, were not ſo good, to be ſure than one that were of an i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> nature, or an errand dunce, or which is worſt of all a bad liver. Let them that call Malice and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge by the name of zeal, call this that I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed for moderation, by the name of Lukewarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, (if they ſo pleaſe) I ſhall never take it for ſuch, whilſt I remember what is ſaid <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.22. <hi>But the fruit of the Spirit is Love, peace, long-ſuffering, gentleneſs, goodneſs, meekneſs, &amp;c.</hi> May all that ſhall read this Treatiſe, be in that ſenſe lukewarm; or rather take that advice which is given <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.5. <hi>Let your moderation be known to all men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If the Reader would be aſſured of the Authors <hi>Loyalty</hi> and good affection, I could refer him to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Chapters in this Book, which are demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of it, particularly Chap. 23. <hi>Of obliging Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, &amp;c.</hi> and to pag. 219. &amp;c. where the Authors abhorrence of a popular Reformation, or of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples taking upon them to reform any thing but themſelves and their Families, without the leave and concurrence of Authority, is fully manifeſted. How much the Author is a friend to publick order, and Ordinances, may be ſeen moſt evidently in Chap. 47. where he treateth of the <hi>Rebuilding of Churches.</hi> That the deſign of the Author is not to increaſe the fears and jealouſies of people, but to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage their hopes, and fill them (what he can) with the expectations of good, may plainly appear by the two firſt Chapters, as alſo by the deep ſenſe which he hath elſwhere expreſſed, of the great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencies of fears and jealouſies, ſo much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounding as they do, and the many expedients which
<pb facs="tcp:45718:7"/>he hath humbly propoſed for the extinguiſhing of them.</p>
            <p>How unwilling the Author was to give offence to one or other (eſpecially to perſons in Authority) may eaſily be diſcerned by the ſoft expreſſions he hath generally made uſe of, having ſeldom ſpoken ſharply, or harſhly of any thing, but of <hi>ſharpneſs,</hi> and <hi>harſhneſs</hi> it ſelf (and of other vices as bad as that): Now Chymiſts tell us that <hi>acid,</hi> or ſharp things diſarm, and infeeble each other; and Scripture tells us of God himſelf, that <hi>with the froward he will ſhew himſelf froward,</hi> Pſal. 18.26.</p>
            <p>Two other methods have bin uſed, that no offence might be taken, more than alwaies will be, if any ſin be reproved, which yet muſt, and ought to be reproved. One is, the Author hath been careful as not to rail (like <hi>Rabſhakeh</hi>) ſo <hi>not to talk</hi> (as he did) <hi>in the Jews Language, in the ears of the people that are on the wall, but to ſpeak</hi> to Superiors <hi>in the Syrian Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage;</hi> that is, in a Language that ordinary people underſtand not, when, and ſo often, as any miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of theirs hath been inſinuated. Another Compaſs he hath ſailed by, to avoid the Rock of offence, hath been the culling and chuſing out the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt and moſt inoffenſive inſtances he knew, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to illuſtrate the odiouſneſs of any evil practice. Who is not at liberty without offending any body at this day, to ſpeak his pleaſure, of that little En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine of State, that was ſomtimes called the <hi>Ingage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?</hi> by the impoſing whereof, ſeveral Learned men were caſt, or kept out of preferment. Now where we treat of the undoing of Scholars, we have particularized no ſtratagem ever calculated for that purpoſe, but only that obſolete <hi>Ingagement,</hi> nor have preſumed to ſpeak of any <hi>(par ratio)</hi> or equality of reaſon, that may be againſt any thing elſe.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:45718:8"/>
            <p>Moreover thou wilt find, that my manner is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to ſhow what ought to be done, than to upbraid men for not doing as they ought (and a milder way than that cannot be thought of). In ſhewing what ought to be done, ſome may think me too poſitive, and abſolute, now and then, but I intend no more by it but this, <hi>viz.</hi> to ſignify how fully perſwaded I am of ſuch things in my own breaſt, how confident I my ſelf am of the truth and goodneſs of them; yet not ſo confident of any thing (which he that runs may not read in Scripture) as I am confident of this, that I my ſelf am not infallible, and therefore preſume not to impoſe upon the belief of others, (and as they call it, to <hi>dogmatize</hi>) but ſubmit all that I have written, to the cenſure and correction of bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Judgments.</p>
            <p>Yet as unwilling as the Author was to give any body offence (if it could poſſibly have been avoided) the Book it ſelf will tell thee that he hath dealt plainly and impartially with all ſorts of men, neither ſparing the vices of friends, nor diſowning the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of enemies, neither flattering the former, nor ſlandring the latter; neither extenuating the faults of the one, nor aggravating the faults of the other, but giving every man his due, both praiſe and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praiſe. Now ſome cannot abide to hear of any good that is in their enemies, nor of any evil that is in themſelves and their friends: whereas the truth is, we have all our faults, and ſhould be told of them in a becomming way; yea, our ſelves ſhould ſay with <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 141.5. <hi>Let the Righteous ſmite me, it ſhall be a kindneſs, and let him reprove me, it ſhall be an excellent Oil which ſhall not break my head.</hi> That is, (by the plaineſt <hi>Meioſis</hi> that I know in Scripture, for ſo it is, to ſay that a precious Oil will not break our heads) it ſhall heal my moſt grievous and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
<pb facs="tcp:45718:8"/>wounds (for ſuch are wounds in the head). I ſhall alwaies ſuſpect that book, and that man, that chideth, or commendeth but one ſide, whereas no ſide is ſo good as to have nothing worthy to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned; nor any party ſo bad, as not to have ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing worthy to be commended.</p>
            <p>(Good Reader) thou wilt find me to have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten (as it were) with a pair of ſcales in my hand, weighing out to every one his proper portion. Now he that uſeth ſcales, will ſcarce weigh eaven, unleſs he firſt bring them to play, this way, and the other way, as they uſe to do, before they come to an equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poize, and ſtand quite ſtill. Of this you have one inſtance beſides all the reſt in pag. 32. where all ſorts of perſons who contemn each others different mode in Religion, whoſe Religion for ſubſtance is the ſame with their own, are indifferently and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially cenſured for ſo doing. Beſides all that hath been ſaid, thou wilt find the Author big with deſign to promote good nature, good humor, good temper, peace, forgiveneſs, reconciliation, yea, Chriſtian love, and brotherly kindneſs. I ſay to promote it univerſally, as knowing that <hi>no Paſſeover can be kept without unleavened bread, and the entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a Lamb,</hi> which is one of the mildeſt creatures in the World.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Peace on earth, and good will towards men</hi> (upon which will follow <hi>glory to God in the higheſt</hi>) is very much of the drift and deſign of this Book, and in it the Author goes about, ſaying in effect, as he thinks he hath read St. <hi>John</hi> had wont to do, <hi>My little chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren love one another,</hi> or as we are ſure he ſaith, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.18. <hi>Let us not love in word nor in tongue,</hi> that is, not in word and tongue only (which yet is more than many do) <hi>but in deed and in truth.</hi> He often warns men (and how needful is it he ſhould do ſo?) of <hi>bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb facs="tcp:45718:9"/>and devouring one another, leſt they be conſumed one of another,</hi> Gal. 5.15. and comes in like <hi>Mercury,</hi> with his <hi>Caduceus</hi> or white wand, with which they ſay that Heathen God had wont to lay the ſtrifes of men, and make their contentions fall, whence they called his wand <hi>Caduceus.</hi> By this time thou know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt enough of the Author, or mayeſt know by that time thou haſt read this book over (if it be ſuch as he hath told thee) and for that matter he appealeth to thy ſelf, and to as many more as ſhall vouchſafe to read it: I ſay to read it carefully, candidly, thorowly. For this I preſume, that ſome things in this Book will diſpleaſe at the firſt, that will not diſpleaſe at the ſecond reading, and part of a Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter read ſingly and by it ſelf, may give offence, when the whole (one thing being compared with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother) will give no offence at all. And here thoſe words of <hi>Solomon</hi> would be thought of, <hi>Prov.</hi> 18.13. <hi>He that anſwereth a matter before he heareth it</hi> (that is, heareth it out) <hi>it is folly and ſhame unto him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now a more brief account of the book may ſerve the turn, becauſe thou haſt the book it ſelf before thee, and mayeſt ſoon read it over. The true de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of it is to promote the building and proſperity of <hi>London,</hi> which cannot be effected, but by ſuch wayes and means as would tend as much to the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of all <hi>England,</hi> yea of all the three Kingdoms. Phyſicians ſay <hi>Non curatur pars niſi curetur totum;</hi> meaning if you would cure any unſound part, you muſt cleanſe the whole body. If any ſuch thing have befallen us in this work, <hi>viz.</hi> that we have hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to preſcribe what is as good for all <hi>England,</hi> as for <hi>London,</hi> and would cure the whole (if duly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied) as it ſomtimes falls out that the whole body is cured, by what is applied but to one part, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, when all the reſt of the body is ill but only by
<pb facs="tcp:45718:9"/>ſimpathy and conſent) I ſay if this Book ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain any ſuch <hi>panacea's,</hi> or univerſal remedies, as that it may ſerve, not only for the <hi>Meridian</hi> of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> but of all his Majeſties Dominions (as if calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated for the whole) I ſee no reaſon why any body ſhould be troubled at that.</p>
            <p>In order to the rebuilding and reflouriſhing of <hi>London,</hi> I have conſidered firſt what are the hindran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces both of one, and of the other, <hi>viz. Diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of ſeveral kinds, <hi>Diviſions, Diſcontents</hi> about Religion, and otherwiſe the <hi>Dearneſs of Commodities,</hi> the <hi>badneſs of materials</hi> (as ill burnt Bricks, ſeared Timber, &amp;c. <hi>the diſhoneſty of Workmen, the poverty of many</hi> that are concerned to build, if they had where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withal, the <hi>ill method</hi> that is or hath been uſed in buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, <hi>viz. building altogether ſcatteringly,</hi> and not eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where <hi>joyning the new building to the old,</hi> nor finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any one whole ſtreet, the <hi>fears and jealouſies</hi> of people in reference to the former burning, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to Papiſts, and their deſigns, and in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the many leſſer burnings which have been ſince the great Conflagration of <hi>London,</hi> particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the burning of a ſtately new houſe in <hi>Mincing</hi> Lane: all theſe, and it may be ſome other impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of <hi>Londons</hi> rebuilding and reflouriſhing, I have conſidered as well as I could, and preſcribed ſuch remedies as I was able for every one of thoſe grievous maladies, of moſt of which, not only <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> but all <hi>England</hi> is ſick. I have diſcourſed of the Builders, and aſſiſtants in building, who they muſt be, <hi>viz.</hi> firſt the great God, <hi>who is the maker and build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of all things;</hi> next to him, thoſe that are called Gods, that is, Magiſtrates, by affording counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance to the work, and improving their Authority on the behalf of it: Next to them, good Miniſters (for in all great works <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> had need go
<pb facs="tcp:45718:10"/>hand in hand, as that Text ſaith, <hi>God led his people like a Flock by the hand of Moſes and of Aaron:</hi> and elſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where its ſaid, <hi>They builded and proſpered through the Prophecying of Haggai, &amp;c.):</hi> Next to them, men of able purſes, and good eſtates (though in no publick Offices or Employments, either Sacred or Civil): And laſtly, Men of Art and skill as for matter of building, and whoſe proper work and occupation is in and about <hi>Architecture</hi> &amp;c. Of, or to all of theſe I have ſaid what I thought fit.</p>
            <p>I have in the next place ſhewed how the help and aſſiſtance of all the forementioned may be gained, and procured, as namely, how the great God may be prevailed with to bleſs and proſper the Building (in which ſenſe he is ſaid to be the builder) <hi>viz.</hi> by our keeping his Sabbaths, relieving his Servants, refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming our wayes and doings that are not good, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>building places for his Worſhip (out of love to Publick Ordinances) ſeeking of his Kingdom, and the Righteouſneſs thereof in the firſt place, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding good and pious ends to our ſelves in that great undertaking, humbling our ſelves under his mighty hand, ſeeking his face and favour by Prayer and Faſting, walking humbly with God, and by thankfully acknowledging what God hath done for the City already. How we may engage the Gods that are upon earth (Magiſtrates I mean) to put their helping hand to this work, I have ſhewed Chap. 23. As for Miniſters, if they be good, they will be forward enough to quicken and encourage ſuch a work as is the building of the City, and their intereſt may go very far, and contribute very much. To rich men I have ſpoken Chap. 42. where I have preſſed them to the exerciſe of mercy and Charity towards an undone City (for ſo it is at preſent) and all its undone Citizens: alſo in the Chapter of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>building
<pb facs="tcp:45718:10"/>Churches,</hi> I have again called upon the bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els and compaſſions of all rich people throughout <hi>England.</hi> As for all Tradeſmen and Artificers, whoſe ware or work belongs to building, I have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured them to be honeſt, and to do their beſt for and towards the rebuilding of <hi>London,</hi> and to uſe that Mother of theirs kindly in all reſpects, and upon all accounts (Chap. 8.). As for the old Inhabitants, I have wiſhed them to replant themſelves within the Walls, that <hi>London</hi> may flouriſh again, Chap. 36.</p>
            <p>For and in order to the rebuilding of <hi>London,</hi> I have further propounded (in diſtinct Diſcourſes) that good Magiſtrates may be choſen into thoſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of power which are conveyed by Election, that ſuch Miniſters may be incouraged as can do much by their intereſt in the eſteem and affections of the people, that trading may be encouraged and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, that the burthens of <hi>Londoners</hi> may be eaſed for the preſent, that a general content and ſatisfaction may be given, (ſo far as is poſſible) whilſt this work is in hand, that they would build the New City con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiguous with the old, and continuous with it ſelf; that is to ſay, that they would begin where the Fire made an end, and build ſome whole ſtreets toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; And laſtly, that there may be a contribution of aſſiſtance to that work from all parts of <hi>England,</hi> (by men, or moneyes, or advice, or whatſoever elſe may promote and further it) yea from all parts of his Majeſties Dominions.</p>
            <p>As motives thereunto I have (in intire chapters) ſhewed the great conſequence, and importance of the rebuilding of <hi>London,</hi> and that it be done with all convenient expedition, and how that not only <hi>England,</hi> but alſo <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and indeed all <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> is concerned therein: (at leaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
<pb facs="tcp:45718:11"/>the proteſtant part thereof) I have diſcourſed how pleaſant the work of building is (Chap. 39.) alſo how much more profit may probably be made of building in <hi>London,</hi> at this juncture of time, than of laying out money moſt otherwaies, yea how much it would be for the honour of thoſe, that have wherewithall, to have a conſiderable ſhare, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion in the building of <hi>London.</hi> I have likewiſe ſet before my reader the ſad face of <hi>London</hi> at this day, how pitifully it looks, and how the mournful viſage of it doth beſpeak relief from all that ſee, or hear of it (Chap. 15.) I have alſo in the ſame chapter taken notice of the many houſes which are already built, or begun to be built, up and down, here and there; whereby a great obligation is laid upon <hi>Londoners</hi> to go forward with the City, leaſt they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur the name of fooliſh builders, who begin to build, and cannot make an end.</p>
            <p>Laſtly I have ſhewed how the proteſtant Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and the principles thereof, do as much ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige to works of charity, ſuch as is the building of Churches, and Schools, and Hoſpitals, as any prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples in the popiſh religion can do, though that religion upbraideth ours with a dead faith, which worketh not by love, and doth arrogate all the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to it ſelf.</p>
            <p>Thus (good Reader) have I given thee an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, firſt of the Authour, and nextly of his deſign, or of the book it ſelf? and what thou art to expect in it.</p>
            <p>Would I be ſo fooliſh as to boaſt of any thing contained in this work (which becometh me not to do) it ſhould be of my having written ſo diſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſſedly as I have done, ſo like a man addicted to no party, but ſtudious of the good of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity, or of the whole Church and ſtate, or as
<pb facs="tcp:45718:11"/>one that were unbiaſſed, either by fear or favour, as a perſon of a free and uningaged mind, and that had never known ſuch a thing as <hi>Intereſt,</hi> as it ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in oppoſition to religion, reaſon, equity, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, ingenuity, mercy, &amp;c. In which ſenſe we take the word, when we ſay of this or that man, that he was acted or led by <hi>Intereſt,</hi> for we commonly add, and not by conſcience, or againſt conſcience? It was <hi>Intereſt</hi> made <hi>David</hi> to murther <hi>Uriah,</hi> hoping thereby to have concealed his adultery, and <hi>Ahab</hi> to take away the life of <hi>Naboth</hi> that he might get his vineyard, and the <hi>Jews</hi> to ſuborn the miſreport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Jeremiah, Jer.</hi> 20.10. <hi>Report ſay they, and we will report it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Intereſt</hi> in the ſence I here diſclaim it, is nothing elſe but diſingenuous ſelf-love, diſhoneſt ſelf-ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, an over-weaning, and unjuſt addictedneſs to a mans ſelf, and to the party which he hath eſpouſed, a gift that blinds the eyes of the wiſe, a love ſo blind, as that it will not ſuffer men to ſee either the evil that is in themſelves, and their friends, nor yet any thing that is good, and commendable in others, it is that principle which inclines men to Deifie, or make Gods (or rather Idols) of ſome men (whoſe perſons they have in admiration for advantage ſake) and Devils (or ſomething almoſt as bad) of others (though they be not ſuch.)</p>
            <p>He that acts from Intereſt is one that cares not how much hurt he doth to others in their names, or eſtates, or other concerns, ſo he can but do him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf any good (as he counts good) by means there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, he is one that purſueth his ſelfiſh deſigns, right or wrong, <hi>per fas &amp; nefas,</hi> and will trample upon every thing that ſtands in the way thereof, <hi>Jonah</hi> was tranſported by <hi>Intereſt,</hi> when <hi>it diſpleaſed him exceedingly, and he was very angry becauſe that God had
<pb facs="tcp:45718:12"/>repented of the evil, that he ſaid he would do unto the Ninivites, and did it not.</hi> Jonah 3.10.4.1. That is, he had rather all <hi>Nineveh</hi> had been deſtroyed <hi>in which were ſixſcore thouſand perſons that could not diſcern betwixt their right hand and their left;</hi> than that himſelf ſhould have been hardly thought of, through the non-accompliſhment of his prophecy: which infamy too, might have been prevented, by the <hi>Ninivites,</hi> conſidering that the threatning was not without this known reſervation, <hi>viz.</hi> that in caſe they repented not, deſtruction ſhould over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take them.</p>
            <p>Intereſt is a ſtrong bias which ſuffers no man to go right on, as no bowle can go ſtraight to the mark, (but muſt wheele about) if it have a great bias. Now if I can waſh my hands in innocency from any thing, I can do it in reſpect of that kind of Intereſt which I have now deſcribed, its ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling it ſelf with this book. I have not written like a Lawyer that ſpeaks all he can for his clients, and takes no notice of any thing that makes for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe cauſe, but rather as a juſt umpire, or mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator, that heareth or alledgeth, what can be ſaid on both ſides, and having ſo done, gives to each its due, and brings the buſineſs to a fair compromiſe, as may (though poſſibly it doth not) give full content and ſatisfaction to both parties. Yet when all this is ſaid, and done, ſo captious and cenſorious, is the age we live in, that ſome will take offence at what I have written, and poſſibly they moſt of all to whom there is leaſt appearance of any offence given: for ſome men (ſuch is their peeviſhneſs) will be more angry, <hi>if you do but look over their hedg, than others if you had ſtollen their horſe</hi> (as I may allude to our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb) There are ſome that cannot bear any thing of a reproof, though as much too mild for them as
<pb facs="tcp:45718:12"/>was that of <hi>Eli</hi> to his wicked ſons, though as pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently couched as was <hi>Nathans</hi> to <hi>David</hi> in the parable wherewith he ſurpriſed him, yea there are, whoſe property it is to take a reproof moſt hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouſly from their friends, as if they would have none but enemies, and thoſe they counted wicked to chide them, whereas <hi>David</hi> ſaith <hi>let the righteous ſmite me,</hi> or as if it were the part of an enemy, and not of a friend, to reprove, whereas the ſcripture ſaith, <hi>Thou ſhalt not hate thy brother, thou ſhalt in any wiſe rebuke thy neighbour, and not ſuffer ſin upon him, Levit.</hi> 19.17. A rebuke from an enemy ſeldom doth good, becauſe it is thought not to ſpring from love, if then our friends muſt not reprove us nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, we have excluded one ordinance of God, which was appointed for good, <hi>viz. Admonition</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion.</hi> We cannot indure our ſawces ſhould be to ſweet, but if a little tartneſs, or ſharpneſs, be found in them, they pleaſe us better, why then would we have the writings of men to be luſcious? why ſhould a little ſharpneſs in a book blunt our appetite thereunto inſtead of whetting it?</p>
            <p>If thou haſt no faults he wrongs thee that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves thee, but if thou ſayeſt thou haſt none, thy ſo ſaying, or thinking, is a fault, <hi>(for he that ſaith he hath no ſin is a lyar)</hi> and if thou haſt faults, he that tels thee of them, in an humble modeſt way, doth thee a kindneſs, and if a man do thee a kindneſs, why ſhouldſt thou be angry with him for it? Books ſhould be read as well to inform us in what we are wrong, as to confirm us in what we are right, not ſo much to be our interpreters, to ſpeak out that which we thought before, and had a mind to have ſaid, rather by others than by our ſelves, but to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct us what we ought to think, to rectifie our judgments, and practiſes, wherein ſoever they are
<pb facs="tcp:45718:13"/>amiſs. If men give us our due (commendation I mean) why would we have more? it being a fault we miſlike in watermen and coachmen, when they will not be content with their full fare, unleſs you give them ſomething over and above.

            <p>He that would profit by this book muſt reſolve before hand <hi>to eat his hony comb with his hony (Cant.</hi> 5.1.) to pare his apple, and pull out the core (if there ſeem to be any) and feed upon the reſt, he muſt know how to make a good meal, at a table where are many diſhes, though every diſh, or part of a diſh, do not pleaſe his palate. If I read a book in which are ſeveral paſſages that I can make good uſe of, though in it there be divers other things, that do not ſuit my <hi>Genius,</hi> I ought not to cenſure the authour, or to repent of my reading it. Poſſibly thoſe paſſages may be of moſt uſe to others, which were of none to me, and thoſe expreſſions may give others greateſt content, which gave me leaſt. I am beholden to him from whom I receive any good, though not all the good I could have wiſhed to receive.</p>
            <p>Set but candor and charity at work, and thou mayeſt find an excuſe for all ſuch paſſages in this book as may not ſo well ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>it thee. If ſome expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions (to thy thinking) do ſavour of two much me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy, ſay it may be the Authour hath had a great many things to expoſe him thereunto, and thou ſayeſt right: If thou fancy the colour of other paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages as much to light and pleaſant, as the former were too ſad, bethink thy ſelf that melancholy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are apt to be in extreams (and yet mean no hurt) and no wonder neither, ſith <hi>all the mirth of melancholy perſons is triumph, and that triumph becauſe
<pb facs="tcp:45718:13"/>they have obtained victory over that black enemy</hi> (me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy I mean) out of whoſe Clutches they are newly eſcaped for a time.</p>
            <p>What an uncharitable man would call youthful and aery, be thou pleaſed to call the <hi>hypocondriaeal wind,</hi> and if it ſeem to lighten in thy face, now and then, call thoſe flaſhes the <hi>eruptions</hi> of a melancholy cloud, torn in ſunder; and rather than be too angry, think the Authour to be ſcarſe himſelf, (the reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of being mad is an apron of fig-leaves that will cover any nakedneſs.)</p>
            <p>One thing more I muſt advertize thee of, <hi>viz.</hi> that if thou deal fairly with the Authour of this poor treatiſe, thou muſt make him a fourfold allowance, one as a man (for that all men have their weakneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes) another, as a man weaker every way than many other men, a third as a man weaker at this time than himſelf (having had many troubles, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements to make him ſo;) and laſtly as a man that meaneth well, and had an honeſt deſign, in what he hath written (as the ſerious peruſal of the book may aſſure thee.</p>
            <p>I might have told thee that in many paſſages of this book, I ſeem to my ſelf to have followed the motion of the <hi>primum mobile</hi> (or <hi>movens</hi>) of the firſt mover (as the ſpheares do) who hath openly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed his deſire <hi>of uniting,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Nay I deceive my ſelf if I have not in this book anſwered one of the moſt difficult, and inſuperable queſtions (or which hath gone for ſuch) that is put at this day, upon the anſwer whereof very much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends, and that is, <hi>what will give men content? or what is the likelieſt way to ſatisfie all men, or the major part?</hi> I am hugely miſtaken if I have not ſhewed how that may be done, without raſing any one foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, or fundamental law, and without laying an
<pb facs="tcp:45718:14"/>axe to the root of any tree, that is appointed to rule over the other trees in the Foreſt (alluding to <hi>Judg.</hi> 9.) I ſay I have indeavoured to build up a ſtructure of peace, love and unity upon the foundations that are already laid, without preſuming to lay any new ones, or to do any thing more than humbly propoſe, and modeſtly offer at ſome few <hi>preterfundamental condeſcenſions.</hi> If this be as truly performed, as it was intended, the book cannot be uſeleſs, though it did ſignifie nothing elſe. It was a happy cruſe full of Salt, wherewith <hi>Eliſha</hi> healed the naughty waters, caſting it into the ſpring, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 20. if any thing in this book may prove like that Salt, to heal the waters of <hi>Marah,</hi> that is, of bitterneſs, which do even overflow us, and to ſweeten the ſpirits of men, one towards another (as hath been indeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red) I ſhall much rejoyce in the ſucceſs. Fain would I contribute towards raiſing <hi>up the Tabernacle</hi> of love and good will, <hi>that is fallen, and unto cloſing up the breaches thereof,</hi> alluding to, <hi>Amos</hi> 9.11.) If I fall ſhort of what I aimed at, I have that old, and good excuſe to plead, <hi>viz. magnis tamen excidit auſis,</hi> that is, that I have fallen from great and good de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, that I ſhot at an excellent mark, though it was my unhappineſs to miſs it.</p>
            <p>Here thou wilt find ſeveral ſins reproved, and cautioned againſt, namely, <hi>Pride, Penuriouſneſs, Cenſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſneſs, Unmercifulneſs, Undutifulneſs towards ſuperiors, Siniſter ends, ſeeking other things before, and above the Kingdom of God,</hi> and the righteouſneſs thereof, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thou wilt alſo find in this Treatiſe ſeveral graces commended, as namely <hi>Humility, Charity, Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly mindedneſs, Publickneſs of ſpirit, Thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, &amp;c.</hi> alſo ſeveral duties exhorted to, <hi>viz. San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying of the Sabbath, humbling our ſelves under the mighty hand of God in burning the City, reforming what
<pb facs="tcp:45718:14"/>is manifeſtly amiſs ſeeking unto God by prayer and faſting, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Beſides the theological diſcourſes I have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, there are ſeveral others that are purely moral, (for ſo the nature of the ſubject did require) now though in thoſe diſcourſes, which are but mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, (as in Chap. 46. and others) I have given ſcope to my phantaſy, to be a little youthful (or for diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſake it hath taken leave ſo to be) yet have I taken no ſuch liberty, when the matter before me was divine, and ſpiritual, as being a profeſſed ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to any thing like a jeſt, in any thing like a Sermon, or mingled with any matter, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe might become a pulpit.</p>
            <p>If thou art altogether a ſtranger to the art of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Chimiſtry, or of extracting moral and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual conſiderations out of mechanical and ordinary things (like good Spirits out of lees and dregs) thou thou mayſt learn ſomething of it here, for though ſome heads of this book be very unpromiſing, and ſuch as ſome would wonder what good could come out of them (as they ſaid of old, <hi>can any good come out of Nazareth?</hi>) yet thou wilt find the application ſomewhat practical, and profitable, which may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile thee to it, as a good <hi>Moral</hi> might do to a fable, that at the firſt hearing did ſeem but ſlight. There are inſtances of this in Diſcourſe 5, 6, 7. the Titles whereof promiſe little or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
            <p>Wouldſt thou have thy mind to be filled with good, and uſeful thoughts, as thou paſſeſt to and fro the ruins of <hi>London</hi> (as many do very often) and as thou takeſt a view of the new buildings, either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun, or finiſhed, this Treatiſe may furniſh thee with ſeaſonable meditations, with ſome of which
<pb facs="tcp:45718:15"/>if thy heart be in too light a frame, thou mayſt make it more ſerious, and with others, thou mayſt make it more pleaſant, if it be too ſad.</p>
            <p>Theſe are all the uſes, which this Treatiſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth it can ſerve for, and theſe thou wilt ſay are enough, if it perform accordingly, now whether it do ſo or no, is and muſt be left to the reader to judg; but if it do not, the Authour hath failed of his deſign, in whole, or in part.</p>
            <p>Miſpointing and miſprinting have diſturbed the ſenſe now, and then, and made it unintelligible, but if thou pleaſeſt to have recourſe to the table of <hi>Errata,</hi> thou wilt there ſee what the Authour inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, (the ſmalneſs and ſwiftneſs of whoſe hand hath doubtleſs expoſed the Printer to more miſtakes, than otherwiſe he had been guilty of.) I have clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed this book with a Diſcourſe of the Reſurrection of our bodies, (thoſe houſes of clay in which we dwell) (which is that Article of our Creed, which the reſurrection of <hi>London</hi> doth moſt naturally, and eaſily put us in mind of, as the deſtruction of that City, did moſt genuinely lead us into the thoughts of our own death, and diſſolution:) And thus thou haſt an account of the drift, and purport of the whole work.</p>
            <p>I am conſcious to my ſelf that this Treatiſe car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth with it the ſtamp, and impreſſion of many of the Authours weakneſſes (though the proverb be <hi>The eye ſeeth not its ſelf</hi>) but if no man ſhall throw a ſtone at the Authour, till one be found that hath no weakneſſes of his own (or ſhall be thought to have none, when ever he appears in print) though not guilty of, or charged with ſo many as he) I ſay, if the Authour eſcape till then, he is like to ſleep in a whole skin, for good and all.</p>
            <p>I verily think that this poor deſpicable book,
<pb facs="tcp:45718:15"/>will (in the main) approve its ſelf to every mans conſcience, and though not to every mans private humour, and diſhoneſt intereſt, yet to the intereſt of the publick, and good of the community, and that there is not one expreſſion in it, but may be taken in a ſenſe that ſhall give no offence, or by which there ſhall be no <hi>ſcandalum datum,</hi> or offence juſtly given, whatſoever may be unjuſtly taken. Let thoſe that never expoſed themſelves in print, ſuſpend their cenſure but till they do; and let thoſe that are in print already, read theſe lines but with ſo much candor, as they would deſire their own ſhould be read (eſpecially if they have treated of matters hard to be treated of, and ſailed, as the Authour hath done, from firſt to laſt betwixt <hi>Scylla</hi> and <hi>Caribdis,</hi> that is amongſt rocks on every ſide of him) I ſay let them who would themſelves be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrued as well as ever their words will bear, but do as much for me, and it is all the favour in that kind, I ſhall intreat.</p>
            <p>He that doth but glance upon a book, his eye may light unhappily upon ſome paſſage, one, or more which ſingly, and by its ſelf conſidered, may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice him againſt the reſt, and make him reſolve to read no more, whereas, if the ſame perſon had read the whole book over, he would have liked it well, and been no more offended at thoſe very paſſages, than skilful Apothecaries are at the vipers which are in the receit of <hi>Venice Treacle,</hi> which with ſuch and ſuch corrective ingredients, wherewith it is compounded makes it a more ſoveraign anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dote than it would otherwiſe be. (Reader) Thou haſt my pains, and earneſt indeavours on the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of <hi>London,</hi> that it may riſe and flouriſh again, let me have thy pardon for whatſoever is, or ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb facs="tcp:45718:16"/>to thee to be amiſs, in and throughout ſo well intended a work, and (which is more let me have thy prayers) that God would pardon all the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects and miſcarriages of this work, as to matter or manner, and forgive the Authour thoſe ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand talents, in which (upon other accounts) he ſtands indebted to the great God, (as who can know the number of his tranſgreſſions!) as alſo that whatſoever in this book, is of real tendency to perſonal, or national, civil or ſpiritual good may be duly conſidered, entertained without prejudice and (ſo far as is poſſible) brought into practiſe.</p>
            <p>Now my hearts deſire, and prayer to God is, that he would pleaſe to ſay concerning <hi>London,</hi> and <hi>Londoners,</hi> as concerning <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Ephraim</hi> of old, <hi>Since I ſpake againſt him, I do earneſtly remember him ſtill: therefore my bowels are troubled for him, I will ſurely have mercy upon him,</hi> Jer. 31.20. and v. 4. <hi>I will build thee, and thou ſhalt be built, O virgin of Iſrael, thou ſhalt ſurely be adorned, &amp;c.</hi> and v. 10. <hi>He that ſcattered Iſrael will gather him, and keep him as a ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd doth his flock,</hi> and v. 11. <hi>And they ſhall flow to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to the goodneſs of the Lord, for wheat and for wine and for oile,</hi> and v. 12. <hi>Their ſoul ſhall be as a wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered garden, and they ſhall not ſorrow any more at all,</hi> and v. 24. <hi>Turn again O virgin of Iſrael, turn again to theſe thy Cities,</hi> and v. 28. <hi>And it ſhall come to paſs that as I have watched over them to pluck up and to break down, and to throw down, and to deſtroy, and to afflict, ſo I will watch over them to build, and to plant;</hi> and v. 23. (for I may not recite all) <hi>As yet they ſhall uſe this ſpeech in the land of Judah, and in the Cities thereof, when I ſhall bring again their captivity, the Lord bleſs thee O habitation of Juſtice, and mountain of Holineſs.</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:45718:16"/>I ſay that God would uſe the like expreſſions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>London,</hi> and <hi>Londoners,</hi> as here concerning <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Ephraim,</hi> is the hearty deſire, and earneſt prayer of the unworthy Authour,</p>

            <argument>
               <p>
                  <hi>Of the grounds we have to hope and expect the compleat re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>building of the</hi> now <hi>Ruines of</hi> London.</p>
            </argument>
            <p n="1">1. THe day of the Reſurrection of <hi>London</hi> hath as yet but dawned, at moſt, the Sun there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is yet but one hour high, or therea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouts; the new City is yet but in its Infancy (if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing more then an <hi>Embryo</hi>) the beginnings of the new are not yet ſo great as the ſmall remainders of the old, as therefore it is too early at this time to congratulate it with acclamations of <hi>Grace, Grace</hi> thereunto, as if the top-ſtone were already laid; ſo on the other hand, it is not too late to ſignifie the hopes we have that in Gods good time it will be brought to a happy period, and that it will ſhine forth more and more, as the Sun doth till it come to the perfect day. Sure I am, if the grounds of our hope as to that matter be not vain and frivolous, it cannot be vain and fruitleſs, to divulge and publiſh them, conſidering how many there are whoſe hearts would even fail them, if they ſhould utterly diſpair of <hi>Londons</hi> ever being upon its legs again: As <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> ſaith of himſelf, that <hi>he had fainted, unleſs he had believed to ſee the goodneſs of God in the Land of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, Pſa.</hi> 27.13. This hope (if I miſtake not) is and muſt be a <hi>cauſa ſine quâ non</hi> of all attempts for the rebuilding of the City; that is, ſuch a cauſe, as without which no man will undertake to build upon his own account; for as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.10. <hi>That he that ploweth, ſhould plow in hope;</hi> (as knowing that otherwiſe men would hardly plow at
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:45718:20"/>all) ſo by the ſame reaſon, he that ſoweth muſt ſow in hope too; nor can it be imagined, that any man will throw the ſeed of his care and coſt into thoſe deep Furrows which the fire hath made, unleſs he be competently perſwaded that he or his ſhall in due time reap the benefit of it: I profeſs my ſelf to be ſincerely of that perſwaſion which I now en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to cheriſh in others, <hi>viz.</hi> that the ruinous heap, or that <hi>Chaos</hi> which we now call <hi>London,</hi> will thorough the good will of him that dwelt in the Buſh (the burning Buſh) be once again a goodly Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. And that no man may think this hope of mine to be as a Spiders Web, that may ſoon be ſwept or blown away. I am ready to render the reaſons of it, which are as follow. Firſt, I think it not incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable, that there is no Decree of Heaven pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulged or made known to the contrary, which I the rather inſiſt upon, becauſe it hath been uſual with God to give notice of his purpoſe and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, that the places intended by him for a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual deſolation ſhould never be raiſed up again, as if it had been for that very end (and it is like it was) that men might not labour in vain, planting that which muſt immediately be pluckt up, and ſo building up that which muſt have been forthwith de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed. Thus <hi>Joſhua</hi> (doubtleſs by Divine Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion) as appeareth from <hi>Joſhua</hi> 16. did adjure the people concerning <hi>Jericho,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Curſed be the man before the Lord that riſeth up and buildeth this City</hi> Jericho: <hi>he ſhall lay the foundation thereof in his firſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born, and in his youngeſt ſon ſhall he ſet up the gates of it, Joſhua</hi> 6.20. which was fulfilled in <hi>Hiel</hi> the <hi>Bethe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite,</hi> and his two ſons, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 16.34. That Curſe made ſuch impreſſion, that for more then five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years after, no man adventured to attempt the rebuilding of that City devoted to deſtruction, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:45718:20"/>
               <hi>Hiel</hi> at length took the boldneſs to do it, and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed his two ſons (and as ſome think all his children) upon that dangerous ſervice. A like ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible propheſie of perpetual deſtruction we find denounced againſt <hi>Mount-Seir,</hi> Ezek. 36.9. <hi>I will make thee perpetual deſolations, and thy Cities ſhall not return.</hi> And the reaſon given, v. 5. <hi>Becauſe thou haſt had perpetual hatred, and haſt ſhed the blood of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Iſrael.</hi> Moreover, againſt <hi>Hazor</hi> we find it thus written, Jer. 49.33. <hi>And</hi> Hazor <hi>ſhall be a dwelling for Dragons, and a deſolation for ever; there ſhall no man abide there, nor any ſon of man dwell in it.</hi> Adding one inſtance more, we ſhall have confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this truth out of the mouth of twice two Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, and that <hi>Zeph.</hi> 2.4. will furniſh us with, <hi>As I live, ſaith the Lord, ſurely</hi> Moab <hi>ſhall be as</hi> Sodom, <hi>and the children of</hi> Ammon <hi>as</hi> Gomorrah, <hi>even the breeding of nettles and ſalt-pits, and a perpetual deſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, &amp;c.</hi> v. 10. <hi>This ſhall they have, becauſe they have reproached and magnified themſelves againſt the people of the Lord.</hi> Now if God had ſpoken againſt <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> as againſt <hi>Jericho, Hazor, Mount-Seir, Moab, Ammon,</hi> there had been no hope, ſaving as the threatning might have been interpreted but condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional, (as when God ſaid <hi>Niniveh</hi> ſhould be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed within forty daies) but no ſuch thing ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been denounced againſt this City, where is the ground of deſpair? if there be no Divine Promiſe of and for the rebuilding of <hi>London,</hi> to be ſure there is no expreſs, or manifeſt threatning againſt it, and ſo long there is hope it may take place: When the great God was reſolved that <hi>Jeremy</hi> ſhould not prevail by his prayer for the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> he bids him ſpare his pains, <hi>Jer.</hi> 11.14. and <hi>Jer.</hi> 14.11. <hi>Jer.</hi> 7.16. <hi>Pray not thou for this people, neither make interceſſion to me, for I will not hear thee.</hi> And at
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:45718:21"/>another time God by his Prophet ſaid, <hi>That though</hi> Noah, Daniel, <hi>and</hi> Job <hi>were in the Land, they ſhould deliver but their own ſouls by their righteouſneſs, intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereby that they</hi> ſhould not prevail for others, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 14.14. Might not we in like manner have expected ſome intimation of the Divine Pleaſure, that the rebuilding of <hi>London</hi> ſhould not be ſo much as enterprized; that if we took any ſuch work in hand, it ſhould be at our peril, that we ſhould but ſow the Wind, and reap the Whirlwind, in caſe that were the Will of God indeed? Surely the Divine Goodneſs would forewarn us, that we might not undertake ſo great a work, and all in vain: But ſo far hath God been hitherto from crying aloud to us, not to take in hand the rebuilding of the City, that I ſcarce know any whiſperings to that purpoſe: Nay, methinks that voice whereby God in theſe daies moſt of all ſpeaketh to ſuch caſes as theſe (and that is the voice of Providence, and of the ſeries of Divine Diſpenſations) I ſay that voice ſounds in my ears, (and it is like in the ears of many more) as if it were plainly for it, as if it ſpake articulately, Ariſe and build, up and be doing. For firſt of all, ſince this work was to be done, the great God hath encouraged it by an unexpected meaſure of health vouchſafed; I ſay ſince the City was to be built, God hath taken away the noyſome Peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, which ſtaying ſome time after the fire, we had reaſon to expect the encreaſe thereof, conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how many Families were unhealthfully crouded together in a very ſmall compaſs, and how many green (I mean lately before infected houſes) were forthwith inhabited, which otherwiſe had long re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained empty. The continuance of that deſtroying Angel amongſt us had been ſo great a hindrance to the reſtauration of the City, as nothing could have
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:45718:21"/>been greater, and the removal thereof is doubtleſs as great a help, without which moſt men would have thought of flying or dying, but none of building. Surely that gracious hand which ſo miraculouſly and ſeaſonably removed the Plague, was ſtretched forth in favour of the deſolate City, as to matter of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>building.</p>
            <p>And doth it ſignifie nothing, that God hath or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained Peace for us ſince the fire, a threefold Peace, <hi>viz.</hi> with <hi>France, Holland, Denmark?</hi> and may I not add a fourth, <hi>viz.</hi> with <hi>Spain</hi> alſo? (of no ſmall import to trade and traffique, as Merchants tell us) Hath that Peace no benigne aſpect upon the rebuilding of <hi>London?</hi> could we have built without it, as well as with it? The great dearth and dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of coals that was before the Peace, together with the great plenty and cheapneſs of them, which hath been, and is like to be after it, aſſureth us to the contrary, (Coals being as neceſſary for the making of Brick, of which our new building muſt conſiſt, as Straw its ſelf.)</p>
            <p>Had the late war continued who would have had any heart to have built? who knoweth not how unhappy it is to build with a brick in one hand, and and a bullet in the other? and would not the expence of War quite deſtroy the ſinews of building? which are the ſame with the ſinews of War, <hi>viz.</hi> Money) or had we money enough, where ſhould we have ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials ſufficient for ſo great a work in a time of War? I doubt our <hi>Lebanon</hi> would not ſuffice: we ſhould find the want of Forreign Timber which now we hope will plentifully come in, and that be brought in to build our houſes, and to repair our City, which would otherwiſe have been imployed to deſtroy our Ships, and to oppoſe our Fleet.</p>
            <p>And now I mention Peace, I muſt not forget
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:45718:22"/>the doubling of it (as of <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Dream for more certainty ſake) betwixt our ſelves, and the <hi>Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands,</hi> (beſides thoſe other Nations that may here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after caſt in their lot with us) neither is it only the ſame thing ingeminated, or two Peaces, but nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rically diſtinct; but the latter Peace (if we miſ-un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it not) is ſpecifically different from, and much better then the former; the firſt having been only an engagement not to offend one another, but this to defend and protect each other, as the matter ſhall require. It is a great while ſince I remember any thing ſo generally well reſented, ſo candidly interpreted, ſo thankfully acknowledged, as that League hath been, and chiefly for that it was made with a people of the ſame Religion with our ſelves, beſides their being moſt potent at Sea of all our Neighbours. That Dove Peace, Peace, (for ſo I may call it) with two Olive Branches in its mouth, ſeemeth to me to bring the beſt tidings, as concerning the rebuilding of <hi>London,</hi> of any Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger I have heard of; (though there are ſeveral o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers) and they that think otherwiſe, are I doubt under the power of too much melancholly, (not to ſay prejudice.)</p>
            <p>Is there nothing to be gathered from the late Winter ſeaſon wherewith to incourage our hope, as touching the rebuilding of <hi>London?</hi> If builders might have beſpoken a ſeaſon for their purpoſe, how could they have had a better? To be ſure the Husbandman did not pray for ſuch a Summer-like mild Winter Froſt and Snow had been more ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to his deſires and occaſions: But as if every thing ought to give place to the reſtauration of the City, as if plenty and health its ſelf were not ſo needful, as that (at leaſtwiſe for the preſent) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold a Winter (if we may call it Winter) more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:45718:22"/>to that occaſion and ſervice, then to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other purpoſe; ſo warm, as if the Sun had ſtood ſtill, (as in the daies of <hi>Joſhua</hi>) and would not have ſtirred further from us till it had ſeen the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in ſome good forwardneſs. Thus the great God, who ſent a fierce Wind to promote the burning of <hi>London,</hi> when it was his pleaſure, hath ſent a mild Winter that hath much promoted the building of it, giving us hope thereby it is his will and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure it ſhould be built again.</p>
            <p>I obſerve that God both in the bringing and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving of Judgments, hath wont to make much uſe of Wind and Weather: <hi>So God brought an Eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wind upon the Land of</hi> Egypt, <hi>and that Eaſt-wind brought the Locuſts, Exod.</hi> 10.13. And in the ninth verſe we read, <hi>That the Lord turned a mighty ſtrong Weſt-wind which took away the Locuſts, and turned them into the Red Sea, there remained not one Locuſt in E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt.</hi> So when God had a purpoſe to dry up the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge, it is ſaid, <hi>Gen.</hi> 8.1. <hi>That God made a wind to paſs over the earth, and the waters aſſwaged.</hi> It is like one Wind brought the waters in, as another carried them out: <hi>So God cauſed the Sea to go back by a ſtrong Eaſt-wind, and made it dry Land, that the Iſraelites might paſs over, Exod.</hi> 14.21. And probable it is, that the turning of the Wind brought the Sea back again upon the <hi>Egyptians.</hi> And I am much deceived, if the Wind and Weather, which were much againſt us in the time of the Fire, have not been as much with us, and for us, ſince that, I mean in reference to the warmth and openneſs of the Weather, which are much what the effects of Winds ſuitable thereunto, <hi>Job</hi> 37.9. <hi>Cold cometh out of the North:</hi> And v. 17. <hi>How thy garments are warm, when he qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ateth the earth by the South-wind.</hi> Sith then this laſt Winter God hath made the Heavens to hear the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:45718:23"/>Ruines, and the Ruines to hear the Artificers, and the Artificers to hear the cryes of the poor deject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Citizens, longing to be reſtored, (you know to what I allude) why ſhould we diſpair of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>London</hi> at Land, more then heretofore at Sea, where we have known two already?</p>
            <p>When I conſider how ſpeedily many difficult ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and perplext controverſies, relating to Buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and Proprietors, have been brought to an end, either by the clearneſs of the Law made for that purpoſe, or prudence of the Judges, or extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary peaceableneſs of the parties concerned, or by means of all three together, I cannot but look upon it as a good preſage, that this poor City ſhall be built again: For this methinks is a kind of ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den and unexpected clearing and taking away of that Rubbiſh which did moſt of all threaten to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct the buildings; for who that hath obſerved how long ſome one controverſie about the title of Houſes or Lands, being tryed after the uſual way, (and not as in the Act for building is provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded) doth ordinarily depend (ſome a longer time then I hope the whole City will take up in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>building,) would not have thought that Law-ſuits and Impleadings one of another would have been ſo endleſs, that the City (the building whereof muſt needs wait upon the determination of ſuch matters) would never have had a beginning. But bleſſed be God, it is evident to us by ſome hundreds of houſes already built, and many more Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions laid, that an incredible number of Titles are already determined, even ſo many as might have taken up a whole Age in an ordinary courſe of Law. And hence alſo may we feed our ſelves with hope, that the like diſpatch will be made in and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout thoſe Cauſes which are yet unheard, (or more
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:45718:23" rendition="simple:additions"/>if more can be) ſith by variety of Precedents, and parallel caſes, the work of determination will be eaſier every day then other. This good harmony gives me great hope, and may do the like to others, for why may not a City riſe up by Unity and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as well as fall by diviſion? why may not the former be as powerful to lift up, even from the duſt, as the latter is to throw it down? If God pleaſe to grant the people of <hi>England</hi> as good and eaſie an accord in all other matters, I ſhall yet hope all will be well.</p>
            <p>I ſee a diligent hand at work for and towards the rebuilding of the City, and that increaſeth my hope, that it will be done. When God forſook <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> for a time, and gave it up to the flames, we may remember that men forſook it alſo, I mean, a great part of its Inhabitants, made it their only care and buſineſs to ſecure their goods, but did in effect ſay, let the City go. But now I find that Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens are as active and officious in reſtoring, as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver any of them (for all were not ſo) did ſeem re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs, and careleſs in preſerving of it; methinks e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very body is huge intent upon it, and what his hand findeth to do in it, doth it with all his might, and that in deſpite of all both real and ſuppoſed diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements. I know not the man whom in this caſe I can call a Sluggard, and wiſh him (without wronging him) to go to the Ant and learn his ways; all are as buſie as ſo many Ants, haſtning to and from their ſeveral Mole-hills; not a few were ſo intent upon it, that when materials could ſcarce be had for love or money, when Coals were three or four pound a Chaldron, when Bricks and Timber bore an exceſſive rate, all would not beat them off from building, as if they had been as fond of hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes within the Walls of <hi>London,</hi> as ever <hi>Rachel</hi> was
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:45718:24"/>of children, who cryed out, <hi>Give me children, or I die.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You might ſee by the reſpects which Citizens paid, and do yet pay to the duſt and ruines of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> how they hanker after it, not for what it is, but for what they hope it ſhall be. Do not as many as had wont to be concerned in thoſe affairs, viſit the Ruines yearly, call every Pariſh by its former name, obſerve its bounds, chuſe Officers upon the very place, chuſe Aldermen, and their Deputies, for every Ward that is unſupplyed, nominate Church-wardens, Conſtables, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as if it might be ſaid of <hi>London</hi> as was ſaid of <hi>Lazarus,</hi> that he was not dead, but ſlept; and all thorough the deſire they have it might be raiſed again, for they do know it is more then aſleep, yea, no leſs then dead and bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried. A careleſs, unactive, heartleſs poſture was that in which <hi>London</hi> was deſtroyed, and now I ſee the quite contrary to that, it makes me hope it is about to be reſtored; wherewithall did the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt perſwade himſelf, <hi>That the time to favour</hi> Sion, <hi>yea the ſet time was come, Pſa.</hi> 102.13. The reaſon he gives us is, <hi>For thy people take pleaſure in her ſtones, and favour the duſt thereof, v.</hi> 14. If that were a good argument, that God would ariſe and have mercy upon <hi>Sion,</hi> (as doubtleſs it was, elſe the Pſalmiſt would not have uſed it) we have ſaid and evinced the ſame thing as concerning <hi>London, viz.</hi> ſuch an affection towards it, as the people of God in thoſe daies had towards their deſolate <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> Far be it from me to think that ſo much love, care and pains, ſo many heads, and hands, and hearts, as are ſet at work about our City, with earneſt pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers for the reſtauration of it, will all produce no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
            <p>What though God had a ſufficient controverſie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:45718:24"/>the old City, as for which to ſuffer it to be burnt, may it not be ſaid that poſſibly he hath not the ſame againſt another City, though ſtanding, or intended to ſtand in the ſame place; ſo that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding his permitting the former to be burnt, he may permit another to be built in the room of it? Though ſuch things were done to the dry Tree, (to which I may compare the old City) muſt the like, or ſomething as bad, be done to the green? Chriſt argues from the green Tree to the dry, with a <hi>quanto magis, What then ſhall be done to the dry?</hi> but not <hi>vice verſâ.</hi> God deſtroyed the Old World, but did he not nevertheleſs make a new one, and that in the ſame place where the old one ſtood, and peopled it out of the loyns of thoſe few perſons that did remain of the old? Who knows but that God may have pleaded all that controverſie which as yet he meaneth to plead with us in and by the burning of that one City? The deſtroying of Cities, (and the not ſuffering of them to be reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red is no other then continued deſtruction,) (as they ſay of Conſervation, that it is continued Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) is not work that God doth do every day; it is his act indeed, but his <hi>ſtrange act,</hi> he is uſually long about it, and as it were deliberating with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, as when he ſaid of old, <hi>How ſhall I give thee up O Ephraim, &amp;c.</hi> True it is, that ſin had overſpread the City like a Leproſie, and like that diſeaſe got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten into the very walls of the ſeveral houſes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: but when the walls of the moſt leprous houſe were once pulled down, or the houſe its ſelf demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, (as this poor City hath been) there was an end: nor do I any where find that it was forbidden or ſpoken of as dangerous to build another houſe in the ſame place, or upon the ſame ground, <hi>Levit.</hi> 14.45. Let men charge what they can upon the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:45718:25"/>late City (as ſome in ſpight do charge upon it what it never deſerved) what is now in hand is not that City, nor ſhall it ever partake of its plagues and puniſhments, unleſs it be afreſh polluted with its ſins, or ſome others as great.</p>
            <p>That God was pleaſed to ſpare a remnant of the City of <hi>London,</hi> that it might not be like to <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah</hi> in point of total deſtruction, for the preſent, is to me a further argument of hope, that it ſhall not be like thoſe places in point of perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual deſolation for the future, that it ſhall not <hi>ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the vengeance of eternal fire</hi> in ſuch ſenſe as that phraſe is applyed to the places themſelves, mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they ſhould alwayes lye in aſhes. God having ſpared eight, and no more of mankind, when he brought the Deluge, and but ſeven of any other kind of Creature, reared up a new World out of that ſmall remainder of the old, which he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved as a ſeed for that purpoſe, which it is like to <hi>Noah</hi> and his Family was alſo a pledge that God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended ſo to do. Methinks <hi>London</hi> ever ſince the Fire, hath been like a perſon frighted into a ſwoun, whoſe vital ſpirits are for the preſent concentrated and contracted into a narrower room; (as are the Inhabitants of that Relique of a City at this day) and if it be but ſo, why ſhould we diſpair but it will come to its ſelf again? or ſhall I compare it to one that hath a dead Palſie, who hath ſenſe and motion in ſome parts of his body, though he have little or none in the reſt. The remainder of the old City (as ſmall as it is) doth not a little facilitate and incourage the building of that part that muſt be new, according to the old ſaying, <hi>Facile eſt inventis addere,</hi> it is eaſie to add: Give me, ſaid <hi>Archime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,</hi> but where to ſet my foot in the mean time, and I will turn the World round. <hi>Londoners</hi> by virtue
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:45718:25"/>of that remainder of a City have where to ſet their foot, which is no ſmall advantage: I cannot but reflect upon that paſſage, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 65.8. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, as the new Wine is found in the Cluſter, and one ſaith, deſtroy it not, for a bleſſing is in it; ſo will I do for my ſervants ſake, that I may not deſtroy them all.</hi> The meaning ſeemeth to be this, as when a Vine is grown ſo barren, that ſcarce any good Cluſter of Grapes ſeemeth to be diſcerned on it, whereby it may be deemed to have life in it, and the Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man is above to cut it down, if one chance to eſpy ſome one cluſter that hath Grapes with liquor in them, whereby it may appear there is life yet, he may thereby be induced to forbear the utter rooting out, or hewing down of it, being told there is a bleſſing in it, that is to ſay, ſome life and ſap, giving hope of its recovery, and growing fruitful again. This is the caſe of <hi>London</hi> at this day; though the greateſt part of it be withered and burnt up, yet there is ſome new Wine found in a Cluſter, ſo that one may ſay there is a bleſſing in it, and may hope from thence, that God will not deſtroy it, but will ſay concerning it as of <hi>Jacob,</hi> v. 9. <hi>I will bring forth a ſeed out of Jacob;</hi> that is, thoſe who ſhall be as ſeed, which though ſmall, is apt to grow numerous and great: Neither is it leſs pertinent to this occaſion to allude it to that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie of <hi>David,</hi> concerning <hi>Solomon</hi> and his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 72.16. <hi>There ſhall be a handful of corn in the earth upon the top of the Mountains, the fruit thereof ſhall ſhake like</hi> Lebanon, <hi>and they of the City ſhall flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh like graſs of the earth.</hi> Say <hi>London</hi> be at the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent but as a handful of Corn in the top of a barren Mountain, (whereas it is rather as ſo much Corn in a fruitful Valley) yet may it hereafter by the bleſſing of God come to ſhake like <hi>Lebanon,</hi> and
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:45718:26"/>flouriſh like the graſs of the earth.</p>
            <p>Is <hi>London</hi> the firſt City that ever was burnt and built again? I rather think, that moſt of the famous Cities in the world that were of antient foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, have paſſed thorough the fire firſt or laſt, (it may be more then once) and Phoenix-like have been rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed out of their aſhes. The Scripture tells us of the burning of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> by the King of <hi>Babylon,</hi> (beſides the captivity of the people) and yet in that ſelf-ſame place was there ſo goodly a City and Temple in our Saviours time, as did move his Diſciples to admiration. He that ſhall but glance upon Hiſtory, may furniſh himſelf with inſtances enough of that nature: nor will I ſo far prejudge my Reader as to enumerate them, ſeeming there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to think him ignorant of a thing ſo obvious. Who knows not that <hi>London</hi> its ſelf hath been burnt ſeveral times formerly, (as in my Treatiſe of the burning of <hi>London</hi> I have ſhewed) and yet how Noble a City was it before it was burnt the laſt time, <hi>viz.</hi> in 1666. One while it lay in aſhes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove 80 years, and by that time one would have thought it ſhould have been buried in perpetual fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and forgetfulneſs, and ſome other place have been unalterably poſſeſſed of the preheminence; but after that, in all likelihood it was a body not only dead, but rotten, the very bones and aſhes whereof are ſcare to be found, yet did it lift up its head again, and became greater then ever, as it lately was. Now what Maxime in Logick more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident then this, <hi>A fuiſſe ad poſſe valet conſequentia:</hi> What hath been may be again. God hath raiſed <hi>London</hi> out of the duſt ſeveral times, he is raiſing it, and let us truſt in him, that he will in due time compleatly raiſe it again.</p>
            <p>I have charity and reſpect enough for <hi>Londoners</hi>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:45718:26"/>whatever others want) to fetch an argument of hope even from themſelves, the real piety and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity of many of them (I ſay not of all, for where but in heaven are all Saints?) that for <hi>their ſakes God will return on high,</hi> and ſay of <hi>London,</hi> that it ſhall be built again. He that would not have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed <hi>Sodom</hi> for the ſake of but ten righteous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, (if there had been ſo many there) will (I truſt) not give up <hi>London</hi> to a perpetual deſtruction, out of the regard he bears to thoſe many tens, and hundreds of righteous perſons that are found there; if perſons that live righteouſly, ſoberly, and godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if they that do generally practiſe only ſuch things as are <hi>honeſt, juſt, pure, lovely, and of good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port,</hi> (as it is <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.8.) if they that ſeem to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of whatſoever they know to be ſin, and to make conſcience of every known duty; I ſay, if men and women of ſuch a character may and ought to be taken for perſons truly religious, (as our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour tells us, that a tree is known by its fruits) if they that bring forth fruits meet of faith and repentance, ought to be eſteemed to have both, and not cenſured for hypocrites; then are there I preſume, ſeveral hundreds in and belonging to <hi>London,</hi> whom we are in duty bound (if the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of rational charity be a duty) to own for good Chriſtians; and that they are ſuch, I dare appeal to the conſciences of their greateſt enemies, or the moſt of them, who when upon a Death-bed, or in great diſtreſs, ſhall deſire, and value their prayers to God for them, much more then the prayers of thoſe that have been their moſt intimate aſſociates. I had almoſt ſaid, if there were leſs Religion in <hi>London</hi> then indeed there is, (though God knows there is not that which ought to be) ſome would love it more, and give a better report of it then
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:45718:27"/>now they do; <hi>They count it ſtrange that you run not with them into the ſame exceſs of riot, ſpeaking evil of you.</hi> Could I ſpeak with their enemies, and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves not over-hear me, thereby to be tempted to ſomething of pride, I would ſay, that if God have a people in the world that love and fear him, he hath ſome ſuch in <hi>London,</hi> yea, I hope he hath <hi>much people in that place</hi> whoſe habitation himſelf is, in the ſenſe intended, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 90.1. and as for other habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſhall in due time be provided for by him. I will not now determine in what ſenſe it was ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, but in <hi>Exod.</hi> 1.21. it is thus written, <hi>It came to paſs becauſe the Midwives feared God, that he made them houſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For once I'le venture the ſcoffs and ſcorns of this the profaneſt of Ages, by making bold to ſay, that the many fervent prayers which have been, daily are, and will be offered to God on behalf of this deſolate City, that it may be revived once again, is to me a further ground of hope that it ſhall be ſo. I have evinced already, that there are conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable numbers of good and gracious Chriſtians, in and about the City, to ply the Throne of Grace, for the welfare of it; and the Scripture telleth us, that the <hi>fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much.</hi> I muſt firſt doubt whether there be a God, at leaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe whether God be a lover of righteouſneſs, and righteous perſons, (which the uncontroulable di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates of my conſcience will not ſuffer me to do) before I can think that the prayers of good men ſignifie nothing, and are but as water ſpilt upon the ground. Prayer hath prevailed for greater things then is the building of a City, in the uſe of ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary means: Did it not ſhut and open heaven in <hi>Elijah</hi>'s daies? though himſelf, who offered thoſe prayers, were <hi>a man of like paſſions with our ſelves.</hi>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:45718:27"/>Can it do the greater, and not the leſſer? Did I know the man that would ſay, let no man trouble himſelf to pray for the ſucceſs of my building, I ſhall do as well without, as with all the prayers that can be made on that behalf, I ſhould expect ſome Eminent Judgment to fall upon that man, as hath done upon ſome other eminent Builders, that have gone by the name of Atheiſts.</p>
            <p>Tuſh, 'tis in vain to contradict experience, they that have received many ſignal anſwers of prayers, and on the other hand, have met with great rebukes at ſuch times as they have <hi>reſtrained prayer from the Almighty,</hi> or prayed as if they prayed not, will never believe to the contrary, but that any good undertaking may, and will be much promoted by the ardent prayers of thoſe that have intereſt in God, of which I doubt not but there is a great Stock going for <hi>London</hi> at this day; and it ſhall ſtand for one of the Pillars of my hope in this as in other caſes, that <hi>God hath never ſaid to the ſeed of</hi> Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob, <hi>Seek ye my face in vain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Next unto the prayers and tears of good men, the triumphs and inſultings of bad over a famous City laid in aſhes, gives me ſome of the greateſt hope and confidence, that it ſhall not alwayes lye there. Was it not publickly obſerved, that Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts up and down the Land were never more jolly and jocund, then they ſhewed themſelves ſoon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the burning of <hi>London?</hi> Some helliſh Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors in the <hi>Marian</hi> daies did not more rejoyce in thoſe flames which burnt the holy Martyrs, then ſome of them are ſaid to have done in thoſe which burnt the City. But will the great God alwayes feed and cheriſh ſuch mirth as that? Shall not <hi>their laughter be turned to mourning, and their joy to heavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs?</hi> Hath not the Lord ſeen it, and it diſpleaſed
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:45718:28"/>him? and will it not invite him to turn away his wrath from the City? <hi>Prov.</hi> 24.16. God will not alwayes ſuffer <hi>Philiſtines</hi> to make ſport with <hi>Samp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> but will cauſe the houſe at laſt to tumble a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout their ears and grind them to powder, who made him grind in deriſion. Another City (which therefore we now hope for) would ſpoil the inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent mirth of Popiſh enemies above any thing elſe, and put them quite out of countenance. God ſpeaking after the manner of men, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.27. ſpeaks as if himſelf did fear the inſolency of ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies: <hi>Were it not that I feared the enemy, would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have him ſelf haughtily, &amp;c.</hi> And if ſo, doubtleſs he will take a time to ſuppreſs both it, and them.</p>
            <p>And now methinks I my ſelf am almoſt weary of this ſo long a Chapter; (though conſiſting only of incouragements and grounds of hope) and though I have ſtayed and reſted my ſelf upon thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen ſeveral Pillars by the way, (and thoſe Pillars of hope) I ſhall more eaſily be pardoned, becauſe the Subject is lightſome; and we know that the length of daies uſeth not to be complained of, though that of nights be troubleſome; howſoever <hi>Sol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>mon</hi> telling us, that <hi>it is not good to eat too much ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, Prov.</hi> 25.27. advertiſeth, that ſhortneſs may be wanting where ſweetneſs is not, ſaving as want of ſhortneſs may ſomewhat imbitter that which of its ſelf was ſweet, even as honey (then which nothing is ſweeter.)</p>
            <p>Therefore laſtly, methinks God hath given us earneſt, great earneſt of another City in place of that which was burnt; and what ſhould I mean by that, but the many Foundations that are already laid, yea ſome hundreds of houſes that are built in ſo ſhort a time? (though thoſe hundreds as yet be fewer then were the thouſands of what was burnt)
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:45718:28"/>But ſuppoſe we ſeven or eight hundred houſes fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed already, it being now <hi>March</hi> 12. 1667. and not much above one year and half ſince the Fire, in which time two Winters have paſſed over our heads, and but one Summer, War with three ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Nations was unconcluded when the building began, Trading as dead as could be imagined, Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens generally impoveriſhed, materials and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries, ſuch as Coals, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> at a ſtupendious rate, admit, I ſay, there be yet but eight hundred houſes finiſhed, (though ſome think there be more) is it not a good and a great progreſs, all things conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered? After one of the burnings of <hi>London</hi> I do not find that in 70 years (and upward) ſo much was done towards the reſtoring of it, as hath now been done in leſs then two.</p>
            <p>Is it not remarkable, that ſince the rebuilding of <hi>London</hi> was this laſt time taken in hand, no one diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſter hath befallen it, there hath appeared nothing like an Angel with a Sword in his hand to obſtruct thoſe that have attempted to bleſs the City, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>building of it, as did to obſtruct <hi>Balaam</hi> when he went forth to curſe <hi>Iſrael.</hi> How early did the wrath of God break out againſt the builders of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>richo,</hi> the very foundation whereof was laid in the death and blood of <hi>Hiel</hi> the Founder, his firſt-born Son? But all the foundations that have been laid in <hi>London,</hi> yea and houſes which are finiſhed there, (for ought I learn) have not coſt ſo dear. As <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noah</hi>'s Wife ſaid unto him, <hi>Judg.</hi> 13.23. <hi>If the Lord were pleaſed to kill us, he would not have received a burnt-offering, and a meat-offering at our hands, neither would he have ſhewed us all theſe things.</hi> So may we probably argue, (if I be not deceived) that if God had pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to anticipate the full harveſt of <hi>Londons</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtauration, he would ſcarce have given us ſo timely
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:45718:29"/>and ſo ample firſt fruits as he hath vouchſafed alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: Reflecting upon all that I have ſaid, I doubt not to bid defiance to ſuch as have or ſhall preſume to call <hi>London</hi> by the odious and miſapplied name of <hi>Babylon;</hi> for though it may be ſaid of <hi>London, It is fallen, it is fallen,</hi> yet not ſo (as of <hi>Babylon</hi>) <hi>that it ſhall never riſe again.</hi>

            <p>I ſhall not extenuate the badneſs of our preſent circumſtances, it is too too evident, that we look like a Land meeted out for deſtruction; the face of things at this day is as it were <hi>facies Hippocratica,</hi> (as Phyſitians call it) that is, we look like death. Never was poor Nation more convulſt, and pulled this way and that way backwards and forwards, and other while made (or endeavoured to be made) more ſtiff and inflexible by a painful <hi>Tetanus,</hi> as they call that kind of Convulſion that braceth the body ſo ſtraight, it can ſtir no way: It muſt be confeſſed, theſe are ill Symptoms, but no grounds of deſpair; poſſibly it is now a critical time with <hi>England,</hi> and the <hi>Criſes</hi> of diſeaſes are often attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with horrid Symptoms, even when Nature gets the upper hand at laſt. Are we now in any more danger to be deſtroyed by our diviſions, then we were in 65. to be devoured by Plague? but thence hath God delivered us: He that hath ſaid unto the Sword of War with other Nations, <hi>Put up thyſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thy Scabbard, reſt and be ſtill,</hi> can ſay the ſame to
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:45718:31"/>the Sword of home diviſions (which are a kind of inteſtine war.)</p>
            <p>Surely <hi>England</hi> hath been in a worſe condition then now it is, and yet ſaved from thence.</p>
            <p>Firſt, in the <hi>Marian</hi> daies, when the weapons of warfare againſt the true Religion were no other then Fire and Faggot, when the Scarlet Whore made her ſelf drunk with the blood of Saints and Martyrs; were not <hi>thoſe daies ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rtned for the Elects ſake, Matth.</hi> 13.20. Afterwards in 88. when the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Fleet, called the <hi>Invincible Armado,</hi> came a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>England,</hi> in how deſperate a caſe did it ſeem to be, but how ſoon did that black Cloud blow over? Then ſucceeded the helliſh Powder Plot in the next Kings Reign, which had it taken effect, had rooted the Proteſtant Intereſt out of <hi>England,</hi> as in the twinkling of an eye, or whilſt a ſmall Paper could be burned, but that alſo came to nothing, that ſnare was broken, and this poor Land deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered. Who doubts whether Popiſh Archers have not ſhot at us many times ſince then, and yet <hi>our Bow abideth in ſtrength thorough the mighty God of</hi> Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob. O <hi>England!</hi> ſo often ſaved by the Lord, why ſhouldſt thou deſpair of any more deliverances?</p>
            <p>Is it becauſe thy ſins are ſo many and great? call to mind what God ſaith, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.33. <hi>In the day that I ſhall have cleanſed you from all your iniquities, I will cauſe you to dwell in the Cities, and the waſts ſhall be builded;</hi> v. 35. <hi>And they ſhall ſay, This Land that was deſolate, is become like the Garden of</hi> Eden, <hi>and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolate and ruined Cities are become fenced and inhabited.</hi> Look back to v. 32. <hi>Not for your ſakes do I this, ſaith the Lord God, be aſhamed and confounded for your own wayes, O houſe of Iſrael.</hi> See alſo v. 22, 23, 29, 36, 38. of the ſame Chapter.</p>
            <p>Or is it becauſe the Lord ſeemeth for a time to
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:45718:31"/>have forſaken thee, having given thee up to flames, that thou, O <hi>London,</hi> deſpaireſt of ever ſeeing good daies again? I ſee not why thou ſhouldſt caſt away the Anchor of thy hope for all that: what if thou ſhouldſt caſt it upon that Text, (and others of like import, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 60.9, 10. <hi>Who will bring me into the ſtrong City? wilt not thou O God which hadſt caſt us off?</hi> And <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.31. <hi>For the Lord will not caſt off for ever, but though he cauſe grief, yet will he have compaſſion ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the multitude of his mercies.</hi> Who ſeeth not the inference plain from ſuch Texts as thoſe, that God may caſt off a people for a time, and yet not caſt them off for ever?</p>
            <p>Is it from a fear of being burnt again, that you have no heart to build? that fear in all likelihood a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſeth from a miſtruſt you have, that the former burning came to paſs by Treachery: if ſo, be of good chear, God will diſcover it in due time, it cannot be alwayes hid; and when that ſecret (if it be yet a ſecret) ſhall be brought to light, when the true Incendiaries ſhall once be known, <hi>London</hi> is like to be more ſecured from fire then ever it was, and that fire which conſumed the old City, will be as a wall of fire (that is a defence) about the new.</p>
            <p>If the great diviſions, diſcontents, and heart-burnings that are now in <hi>England,</hi> be alledged (as they have been) as a main diſcouragement of the rebuilding of <hi>London,</hi> I would take leave to ſay, I hope one day to ſee an end of thoſe things. Surely there will come a time when paſſion and fury will hold their peace, and give way to reaſon and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to interpoſe; and when ever that time ſhall come, ſuch Rules and Principles as I would now ſuggeſt will be hearkened to, and cannot but offer themſelves (being ſo obvious as they are,) and
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:45718:32"/>whenſoever they ſhall take place, we may expect to ſee <hi>England</hi> a quiet habitation, and all good peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple therein of one heart, though not of one mind.</p>
            <p>The firſt principle which I would hope will be received in time is this, That every man pretending conſcience conſtraining him to what he doth, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraining him from what he refuſeth to do, if ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally truſted and thought worthy to be believed in other caſes, ought to be truſted and believed in that alſo, and not to be changed with pride, preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, intereſt, faction, as the true reaſons of thoſe actions for which he pretendeth conſcience, yea it may be expoſeth himſelf to conſiderable ſufferings, as for conſcience ſake, or under that notion. To put no truſt at all in men of good and commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble lives, were to decry the validity of all Humane Teſtimony, and to raze the foundations of all Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Society: Now if we cannot truſt men in this caſe, why ſhould we truſt them in other things? and if we can truſt them in other things, why not in this?</p>
            <p>Secondly, That all ſuch perſons, who in the judgment, and by the principles of Chriſtian cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, ought to be deemed and taken as acting from conſcience, and from a fear of offending God in doing otherwiſe, ſhould at no hand be treated with ſuch ſeverity and rigor, as they juſtly might, if we could be certain, or rationally preſume, that what they did were from ſuch baſe principles, or ſiniſter ends, as pride, contumacy, intereſt, or the like: Who ever had the heart or the face to deal rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly with any man pretending conſcience for what he did, or refuſed to do, eſpecially about indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent things, unleſs he did think (or at leaſtwiſe make as if he thought) that conſcience was but
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:45718:32"/>meerly pretended in the caſe? But if conſcience be really intereſſed and ingaged, (as in the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances before put we ſhould take it to be) the Apoſtles tenderneſs towards thoſe that <hi>had a zeal for God, though not according to knowledge,</hi> will tell us how we ought to carry towards them, <hi>viz.</hi> not only with calmneſs, but kindneſs, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.1.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, That perſons agreeing, and conſenting with us in the main points of Religion, in the ſum and ſubſtance of Chriſtianity, ought not to be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed for their unavoidable diſſent from us in leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer matters at ſo great a rate, much leſs at a greater, then thoſe that vary from us in Fundamentals, and go about to ſubvert the faith; if ſuch be not tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porally undone, and deprived of all wayes of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting for their perſwaſion, much leſs ought theſe ſo to be.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, That they who believe, or profeſs to believe ſo much truth as to Salvation is neceſſary to be believed, and who in their general courſe pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe accordingly, who are alſo peaceably diſpoſed, and will give (or have given) the higheſt aſſurances that men can give, that ſo far as in them lieth, they will preſerve the peace of Church and State; I ſay, that ſuch men ſhould be accounted worthy to live, and have wherewithall ſo to do, (they and their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies) and if able for publick imployment, ſhould be intruſted therewithall, ſpecially at ſuch a time as the Church, or State, or both, have apparent need of their ſervice, and for want thereof are forced to imploy many worſe, and leſs uſeful in their room.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, That men ſhould make no more diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in Church or State then are of abſolute neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and cannot be avoided, (and leaſt of all, ſuch as tend to the ruine of others, though to the raiſing of
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:45718:33"/>themſelves) conſidering what the Apoſtle ſaith, Rom. 16.17, 18. <hi>Mark them which cauſe diviſions and offences, for they that are ſuch ſerve not our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, but their own belly.</hi> Doubtleſs the way to the Church, and to the Communion thereof, ſhould be made plain and acceſſible, as God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed of old thoſe wayes ſhould be which led to the ſeveral Sanctuaries, or Cities of refuge; to be ſure no needleſs ſtumbling blocks, or unneceſſary hindrances, ſhould be laid in that way; neither ought any member (principal member eſpecially) to be cut off from the Church without urgent, and inforcing cauſe, any more then an arm, or leg, or eye, to be ſevered from a natural body, if it and the body can poſſibly be preſerved together.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, that no man ſhould be tempted to ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, or diviſion, by ſuffering ſuch things as may ſeem (if not more then ſeem) to plead for ſuch a practiſe, as namely, by allowing and intruſting ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, inſufficient, and ſcandalous Miniſters: Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions, or rather Dividors, will be quite out of countenance when they have no plauſible thing to plead for themſelves, but if they can ſay the Blind are ſet to guide them, and they to feed them who for bread gave them a ſtone, and for fiſh a Scorpion: who have neither the <hi>Urim</hi> in their doctrine, nor <hi>Thummim</hi> in their lives, ſo long will they divorce themſelves and reſt perſwaded, that in ſo doing they do God and their own Souls good ſervice. This notion is ſo obvious, as may make us hope it will not alwayes be overlookt, if not ſpeedily taken in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſerious conſideration.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, That <hi>the paying tithe of Mint, Anniſs and Cummin,</hi> and mean time <hi>omitting the weightier matters of the Law, Judgment, Mercy and Faith,</hi> (for which Chriſt denounceth a wo to the Phariſees, <hi>Mat.</hi>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:45718:33"/>23.23. that is) a rigorous inſiſting upon leſſer things whilſt thoſe of higher importance are ſlightly paſt over <hi>which is no</hi> other then a <hi>ſtraining at Gnats and ſwallowing of Camels;</hi> is a practiſe that will make any Church obnoxious, not only to the all diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing eye of God, but to the obſerving eye of men, ſuch eſpecially as have little affection for them. If they can ſay we do place <hi>the kingdom of God in meats and drink (in which it conſiſteth not)</hi> rather then in righteouſneſs (wherein it doth conſiſt) they think they have enough againſt us to juſtifie their ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that we make nothing of their Souls, feed them with meer husks, and chaffe and have zeal for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but unſcriptural rites and traditions.</p>
            <p>Eighthly, A little time time cannot but diſcover that to prefer men according to the largneſs, and hardineſs of their conſciences, rather then the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs thereof; is no good rule to proceed upon. It was the commendation of <hi>Joſiah</hi> that his heart was tender, and of <hi>Nehemiah</hi> that he did not do as others becauſe of the fear of the Lord. The worſt of men have the wideſt conſciences, and ſuch a faculty at ſwallowing that nothing can choake them: like ſome bewitched perſons I have read of, they can ſwallow needles, and bodkins and knives, and when they ſee their time caſt them up again in the faces of their owners.</p>
            <p>Ninthly, It cannot be long hid from the eyes of men, who now do leaſt ſee it, that to lay more load upon the conſciences of men (even ſuch as are thought beſt able, to bear it) then they needs muſt, to cauſe them <hi>Iſſachar</hi> like to couch down betwixt ſeveral burthens, to ſcrue up the ſtrings of mens conſciences till they are ready to crack again, to increaſe their task (as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> did by the Iſraelites as if they feared conſcience would otherwiſe be
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:45718:34"/>idle) in a word to gorge the conſciences of men till they are ready to ſpue up all again is no good policy. Conſciences that are overſtretched (like cloth that is ſo) will be apt to ſhrink again, and Oſtriches (which they ſay can digeſt Iron) have anill report as creatures more then brutiſh both for folly and unnaturalneſs, <hi>Job.</hi> 39.14, 18. I ſay it cannot long be hid, that that is no good policy; and therefore if any ſuch thing hath been a cauſe of diviſion, when a few ſucceeding dayes have been by thoſe that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded them, made wiſer then their predeceſſors (as they ſay, <hi>Dies diem docet</hi>) it is like that occaſion of ſtrife and debate will be out of doors.</p>
            <p>Tenthly, It is like the world, ere it be much elder, will be ſufficiently inſtructed that it is no point of prudence to tempt men (even under hatches I mean) to immoderation and fiercneſs, by making it their true and only intereſt, under their preſent circumſtances, to be fire, and tow, not to yield a hairs breadth. They that will have all, or nothing, all that ever they did require, or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that ever they will accept from thoſe that are invincibly witheld by their conſciences from doing all that is required, muſt exſpect juſt nothing at all. For what will men ſay, if we cannot do all that is impoſed upon us, we had as good do juſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. They on whom our dependance is under God (as too many there are that cannot be without dependances noun adjectives like) if we concede any thing, will ſay we are luke-warm, and ſpue us out of their mouths: and as for thoſe that are in power for the execution of thoſe laws, they will not abate us an ace of what they demand had we a hundred fold ſo much of gifts and graces, as either we or they or any man alive hath. What if the law hath left it in their breaſts to diſpenſe with the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:45718:34"/>of it as they ſee cauſe (as by ſuſpending their certificats, &amp;c.) if it be their pleaſure generally not to do it? thence indigent men (and alaſs how many good men are ſuch) will be apt to infer ſince no greater earnings can be made of moderation, than of eagerneſs on one hand, and much greater of eagerneſs, and inflexibleneſs, then of moderation on the other hand, ſince they cannot yeild to every thing, they will yield to nothing, and make an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt (for ſome intereſt they muſt make for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and theirs, or ſtarve) I ſay make an intereſt where they can. Thus men become jealous that they muſt either ruin, or be ruined, and thoſe wounds which by mutual condeſcention might have been healed, by utmoſt oppoſition on both ſides do as it were feſter, and become incurable. Thus the rough anſwer of <hi>Rehoboam</hi> hearkning to his young Counſellors ſet the people all into a flame, who had he taken the advice of his grave Senators, would have found their words true who ſaid 1 <hi>King.</hi> 12.7. <hi>If thou wilt be a ſervant to this people this day and will ſpeak good words to them then they will be thy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants for ever.</hi> As this moſt certain principle that lenity, and condeſcention will do more good then fierceneſs, and exaſperation ſhall by experience be made more evident. I doubt not but our diviſions and diſcontents will heal up by degrees, and the warm ſun will make us throw off that particollored coat, which the boiſtrous wind made us to gird more cloſe about us.</p>
            <p>Eleventhly, Another principle tending to allay our diſcontents is as obvious as any of the reſt (and therefore it is like will be taken notice of ere it be long) viz. That ſomething in point of pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, muſt and ought to be indulged, to the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and complexion of a nation, and to thoſe
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:45718:35"/>opinions and ſentiments which people have long been poſſeſſed with, ſo that they are become as it were a ſecond nature to them: Principles long ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veted in the minds of men, cannot eaſily be extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated. Theſe arbitrary rites and uſages, which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt ſome ſorts of people might make Religion more venerable, with others again that have ſuckt in an invincible diſlike of them, might make it very vile and contemptible.</p>
            <p>Twelfthly, To ſecure a Nation all that may be againſt fears and jealouſies, and to beget in them all poſſible confidence, that nothing is intended, but what is and ſhall be for their good; that I ſay will lay an Axe to the root of diſcontent, as much as any thing that can be done; and that it will do ſo, is ſo well known, that it is ſcarce to be imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the wiſdome of Governors will not prompt to it firſt or laſt.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, That they who are of one and the ſame Religion for ſubſtance, holding the ſame Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Doctrinals, both as to Faith and manners, ſhould not be ſuffered to vilifie and reproach each others different Mode and Dreſs in Religion, and to render one another ridiculous and contemptible, or to repreſent one another, as if the Religion of each were vaine, a meer mocking of God, <hi>Hab.</hi> 3. <hi>As the cutting off a dogs neck, offering of Swines blood, or bleſſing of an Idol.</hi> I ſay, men and women who hold the ſame Fundamentals in Religion, ſhould not be ſuffered to ſcoff and deride one another, as <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lijah</hi> did the Prieſts of <hi>Baal,</hi> (they being Idolaters, but he a Worſhipper of the true God) for <hi>hine illae lachrymae.</hi> This is one as great cauſe of our heart-diviſions, and heart-burnings, as any I know, that we pour out contempt and ſcorn upon the Religion of each other; (though in the main it be the ſame
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:45718:35"/>with our own) and that I muſt tell you is a moſt provoking thing, for he that toucheth a mans Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, toucheth the apple of his eye, and cauſeth him to cry out as <hi>Micah</hi> did, <hi>Judg.</hi> 18.24. <hi>Ye have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away my Gods, and what have I more? and what is this that ye ſay to me, what aileth thee?</hi> Religion is the great Bond of Love, and men are apt to think they are not bound to love one another, when they have learnt to deny and nullifie one anothers Religion. Religion is alſo the Bond of Charity, in point of judging; now when that Bond is once to appearance diſſolved, by a conceit entertained, as if each others Religion were vain, then will there be no end of cenſuring and of exaſperating one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother thereby. How ordinary is it for men to ſay of a foot, becauſe it is not the hand, or of an ear, becauſe it is not the eye, that therefore it is not of the body; but is it therefore not of the body? as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.15. To deny an Epiſcopal man to be a Member of Chriſt his My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical Body, becauſe he is not a Presbyterian, and a Presbyterian to be ſuch, becauſe he is not an Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent, and an Independent to have any truth of Religion, becauſe he is neither of the two former; when every one of the three is of a good and holy life, and ſound in the main, is a point of high in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice and uncharitableneſs. He whom thou cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſureſt, though his different mode and way in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion may not be ſo good as thine, may have more acceptance with God then thy ſelf, if more ſincere and zealous, and true to thoſe main principles in which you both agree, then thou thy ſelf art: <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.27. <hi>Shall not uncircumciſion by nature if it fulfill the Law, judge thee, who by the Letter and Circumciſion doſt tranſgreſs the Law?</hi> But nothing more ordinary in this Age, then for men to vilifie others, who are
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:45718:36"/>much their betters, both as to gifts and graces, which is ſo irrational a thing, that one would think it ſhould eaſily be apprehended and avoided.</p>
            <p>We bring Religion its ſelf (even that which is truly ſo called) into great diſ-eſteem, whilſt we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to own it in any dreſs but one; for if all ſhould do ſo, Religion (ſo and ſo modified) would no where have the applauſe and ſuffrage of any more then one party of men, (if there be twenty) and fall under the cenſure and condemnation of all the reſt. By that means the faith of ſuch as are weak would be ſtaggered, and they would be tempted to queſtion the truth of that Religion which is repreſented to them as peculiar to themſelves, though it be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed common to all ſound Chriſtians, and ſober Proteſtants, (that is) ſo much of it as the Church of God determineth to be <hi>de fide,</hi> that is, of abſolute certainty, and neceſſary to ſalvation.</p>
            <p>That men of another Opinion then our ſelves are of in matters controverted, are therefore of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Religion, and that utterly vain, is a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that hath bred a great deal of ſtrife and debate; but a principle ſo fond and ſenſleſs, ſo ignorant and arrogant, that one would think it ſhould eaſily be parted with, and when ever men ſhall let it go, the fire of our diſſentions would ſlake preſently, and that if love to one another begin to kindle; why ſhould men ſay in oppoſition to one another, <hi>Lot here is Chriſt</hi> viz. <hi>in the Deſart, or there</hi> viz. <hi>in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Chambers:</hi> (as it is <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.26.) whereas Chriſt may be here and there too, and hath ſaid, that <hi>whereſoever he recordeth his name, thither he will come.</hi> Surely there are not fewer different Opinions as to Religion openly profeſſed in the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> then are in <hi>England;</hi> neither are there fewer different modes and wayes in, and of the exerciſe of
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:45718:36"/>Religion there, then here, yet there they are qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et, and here we are all in an uproar: And what is the reaſon, but becauſe here we are alwayes biting and devouring one another, as if it were a part of our Religion, to oppoſe and vilifie the Religion of others, though but circumſtantially differing from our own; whereas we ought to have charity, and Veneration for it, as agreeing with our own in the moſt material things; and as the Apoſtles rule is, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.16. <hi>Whereto we have attained already, walk by the ſame rule, and mind the ſame things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now the cauſes of our diviſions being ſo mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt as they are, and the cure ſo eaſie (as appeareth by the obviouſneſs and eaſie practicableneſs of thoſe thirteen healing Principles which I have laid down) why ſhould we deſpair that thoſe cauſes will ever be removed, and our diviſions and diſcontents at length healed? Surely there is Balm in our <hi>Gilead, Jer.</hi> 8.22. there is ſome Phyſitian there; though the health of the Daughter of our people be not recove<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>red, nay give me leave to ſay, that I think our wounds are not ſo great (as great as they are) but that they might be cured with <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nguentum Apoſtolorum</hi> (if I may ſo call it) I mean ſuch as is preſcribed <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. almoſt throughout that Chapter, eſpecially if for better digeſtion ſake, a little <hi>Baſilicon</hi> were added thereunto.</p>
            <p>All the Objections I have now left to anſwer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the building of <hi>London,</hi> are thoſe which were taken from the preſent poverty of the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the fear of future troubles, both from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, and at home. I much fear what was ſaid of <hi>Cinna</hi> is true of <hi>London, Cinna videtur eſſe pauper &amp; eſt pauper, London</hi> doth not only ſeem to be much impoveriſhed, but is really ſo: And how can it o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe be, all things conſidered? But muſt Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:45718:37"/>therefore quit their trades? How ſhall they ever be rich again but by means of trading? yea how can many of them ſo much as ſubſiſt without it? And if trade they muſt, where ſhould they trade but in the City? and how ſhould they trade there unleſs they build again?</p>
            <p>Whereas the fear of future troubles hath been inſinuated, as an argument againſt building, it cannot be denied but that our manifold ſins, and preſent diſtractions, may cauſe us to exſpect them.</p>
            <p>But firſt of all may not the infinite mercies of God, poſſibly prevent the confuſions which we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, and not ſuffer the things we fear to come upon us: or may not the Divine patience reprieve the Nation for ſome conſiderable time? (as the old world was reprieved after ſentence denounced) and if ſo, will it not be every mans wiſdome to make the beſt proviſion he can for him and his in the mean time? ſhall men certainly and forthwith undo themſelves for fear of being hereafter undone?

Go which way you will to work, to improve your eſtates you ſhall run an adventure. He that layeth out his mony upon lands ſhall have little profit, great taxes, and it may be bad title: he that will turn Merchant muſt run the hazard of winds, and ſeas, and ſhelves, and ſands, and Pirats, unfaithful ſervants at home, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſcionable and uncontroulable Factors abroad. He that ſhall put his mony to intereſt (beſides that

            <argument>
               <p>
                  <hi>Of how great Conſequence it is that the now waſt and deſolate City of</hi> London <hi>ſhould be re-edified.</hi>
               </p>
            </argument>
            <p>SUrely it was not without cauſe that <hi>London</hi> (whileſt ſtanding) hath always continued the <hi>Metropolis</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> though no ſuch promiſe were ever made to it, as unto <hi>Judah</hi> of old, that the ſcep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or principality, ſhould never depart from it, and though an old prophecy hath been, that <hi>London was and York ſhould be,</hi> Yea though <hi>London</hi> hath ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral times ceaſed to be its ſelf, for a while, lying in aſhes, as now it doth (once fourſcore years toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) and other places have ſucceded in the Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politanſhip for that time, yet no ſooner was it raiſed again, but other places (as if but its Deputies, and Viceroies) did preſently reſign the prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence to it, and like to <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> come from graſs, and turn'd man again, it was preſently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inthroned, and reſtored to its former dignity and Primacy. This I ſay was not for nothing, but did certainly imply there was ſomething in the place, the ſcituation I mean (for ſometimes little elſe hath been left) that did render it much more fit, then any other to be the <hi>Metropolis</hi> or head City of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> ſo that as often as <hi>London</hi> was in being, no other town or City would offer to come in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition with it. It was the river <hi>Nilus</hi> made <hi>Egypt</hi> rich, and fruitful, and hath it not been the River of <hi>Thames</hi> hath alwayes (under God) made <hi>London</hi> what it was. They that would utterly deſtroy <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> muſt dry up that River (as the river <hi>Euphrates</hi> for the deſtroying of <hi>Babylon</hi>) or ſet it at ſome greater diſtance from that City. For whilſt they two ſtand
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:45718:38"/>ſo near together, <hi>London</hi> is like to be rich, and fruitful, <hi>like trees that are planted by the rivers of water</hi> or like meadow ground that is overflown. What is ſaid of <hi>Joſeph</hi> is like to be verified of <hi>London, Gen.</hi> 49.22. <hi>Joſeph is a fruitful bough by a wall whoſe branches run over the wall.</hi> By the ſide of <hi>London</hi> is planted that great trunk of the <hi>vena porta</hi> of the Nation, I mean, the great mouth, and inlet of trade (the river of <hi>Thames</hi> I mean) which makes it ſo neceſſary for <hi>England,</hi> that <hi>England</hi> cannot much better ſubſiſt without it, (that is to ſay in wealth and proſperity) then a man can live whoſe mouth is ſowed up, and who can take no nouriſhment but as a glyſter, no breath but at his noſtrils. They are deceived that think <hi>England</hi> may be deſtroyed meerly and only by deſtroying <hi>London</hi> for a time, for if <hi>England</hi> its ſelf be not firſt deſtroyed, it muſt and will (God permitting) always have another <hi>London</hi> let the former be burnt, or demoliſhed ever ſo often: <hi>London</hi> is the heart of <hi>England,</hi> and if it were not <hi>primum vivens</hi> it will be <hi>ultimum moriens</hi> at leaſtwiſe. <hi>England</hi> if it do not die firſt muſt die not long after it, for without a heart it cannot long live. If <hi>London</hi> fall it muſt riſe again, or all <hi>England</hi> muſt fall too, at leaſtwiſe into great miſery, diſgrace, and poverty. <hi>London</hi> is the place to which thoſe paſſages of the Prophet concerning <hi>Tyre</hi> are moſt applicable of any place I know, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 23.4. <hi>Thou whom the Merchants that paſs over ſea, have repleniſhed; the harveſt of the river is her revenue, and ſhe is a mart of Nations, &amp;c.</hi> v. 8. <hi>The crowning City, whoſe merchants are Princes, and whoſe tr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ffiquers are the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable of the earth.</hi> At leaſtwiſe this ſhe was <hi>fuimus troes &amp; nigens gloria</hi>) and this with the bleſſing of God ſhe is moſt capable to be again. And is it not of great conſequence that a City of ſo vaſt a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment to the whole nation ſhould be rebuilt.</p>
            <pb n="40" facs="tcp:45718:39"/>
            <p>Which of all our famous Cities is fit to make a Head for ſo vaſt and Noble a Body as <hi>England</hi> is, <hi>London</hi> excepted? There is much deformity and inconvenience in a Head that is much too little for the body, as in one that is too big: Beſides, if a head be not well ſcituated; as ſuppoſe a mans head were placed upon his arm, or back, and not upon his ſhoulders, ſuch a poſture would be not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inconvenient, but monſtrous. And verily any other <hi>Metropolis</hi> for <hi>England,</hi> beſides <hi>London,</hi> would be of like inconvenient poſiture and ſcituation; the head would not ſtand in the right place, either for commodiouſneſs, or decency.</p>
            <p>I would know what great Kingdome there is in the world, that hath not a <hi>Metropolis</hi> or Head City anſwerable to its ſelf? And why ſhould <hi>England</hi> differ from all the reſt? ſhould we be unlike all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Nations, and become their ſcorn?</p>
            <p>Is not ſome one City magnificent and ſplendid above all the reſt (like the Sun that out-ſhineth all the other ſtars) greatly for the honor both of a King and Kingdome? I had almoſt ſaid <hi>England</hi> looks ſneakingly whilſt it is without a <hi>London,</hi> it doth as it were hide its head in the duſt, and ſeemeth to be aſhamed of its ſelf, if it have any head to hide.</p>
            <p>Tell us not of the Suburbs, Citizens know how inconvenient they are for their buſineſs, over what the City is; and beſides, both together are little enough for traders, and other inhabitants, elſe it might have ſaved them charge and trouble to have dwelt in houſes built to their hands, and well ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned; they durſt not go after the declining Sun, leſt they themſelves ſhould decline alſo in their trade and buſineſs. They found more warmth in the heart of <hi>London,</hi> then ever they expect in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme parts, as they ſay of arterial blood that is
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:45718:39"/>warmeſt, for that it cometh immediately from the heart. Cottages within the walls ſeem to pleaſe and accommodate them better then ſtately houſes without.</p>
            <p>He that thinks the rebuilding of <hi>London</hi> might well be ſpared (if any man or woman can ſo think) let him or her, conſider how many houſes upon ſurvey are ſaid to have been conſumed by the late fire, viz. no leſs then thirteen thouſand, or there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts: now many of thoſe houſes did contain two, ſome three families apiece, ſo that we may well ſuppoſe twenty thouſand families, moſt of them tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, to have been by that fire diſpoſſeſt, now where ſhall ſo many thouſand families of trading people be diſpoſed of if <hi>London</hi> be not built again? ſhall they go into the country and trade there? how inconvenient and inſignificant would that be, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that ſo to do were to eat the bread out of the mouths of country ſhop-keepers. Whilſt they live at a diſtance from them Citizens are helpful to tradeſmen in the country, as the ſun when it is far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſt removed from the moon, ſhines full upon it, and exhibits that which is called the full moon, but when they two are in conjunction, then doth the Moon diſappear, being ſwallowed up by the greater light, and brightneſs of the Sun.</p>
            <p>Say not that Citizens are already diſpoſed of and ſetled well enough; for are not divers of them for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to live in the country to this day and to leave off their trades ever ſince the fire as not knowing where to accommodate themſelves in or about the City. And as for others, who ſince that time have planted themſelves either in the City or ſuburbs? how incommodiouſly are many, if not the moſt of them ſcituated both as to their trades and families? how do they complain, of being pent up and
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:45718:40"/>ſtreightned for want of room, how unſweet and unpleaſant are many of their dwellings, how pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate and obſcure? do not ſome of them ſeem to dwell more like <hi>Diogenes,</hi> then like themſelves? at leaſtwiſe rather in tents, and booths, then in houſes? who knoweth theſe things to be ſo, and yet hath the heart to ſay that Citizens are well enough as they are and that it is no matter if <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> never be rebuilt. If God had not more love and pitty for them then they have that ſay ſuch things, I know what they muſt truſt to, but to the ſhame and confuſion of their faces, who care not what becomes of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Londoners</hi> and in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpight of all the terrible predictions of Aſtrologers threatning us with I know not what ſad effects of a third Comet. I doubt not but through the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God <hi>London</hi> (as ſinful a place as it is) will be built again.</p>
            <p>And now a word to the Aſtrologers their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions: becauſe I hinted that objection in the ſecond Chapter, and then forgot to anſwer it, what Aſtrologer in the world can aſſure us that when three Comets appear together, or within a little time one of another, each of them doth portend a ſeveral judgment, hanging over the head of that nation, or people which thoſe Comets ſeem to point at. As <hi>Joſeph</hi> told <hi>Pharaoh, That the ſeven good kine are ſeven years, and the ſeven good ears, are ſeven years: and the dream is one, Gen.</hi> 41.26. That is, the two things he dreamt of, did point out but one and the ſame event: and as Joſeph had two ſeveral dreams, <hi>Gen.</hi> 37.5, 9. one about the Sheaves, and the other about the Sun, Moon and Stars, which were but one, and the ſame in ſignification ſo it may very well be that two or three Comets may point out but one and the ſame judgment.</p>
            <pb n="43" facs="tcp:45718:40"/>
            <p>But admit that each of thoſe Blazing Sars were intended to foretel a ſeveral Judgment, it doth not follow that one of the Judgments thereby por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended muſt needs be yet to come: for if I miſtake not we have had three ſore Judgments ſince thoſe Comets, <hi>viz.</hi> Plague, Sword and Fire. But what I have here ſaid to Aſtrologers I confeſs to be a digreſſion in this place, and only the ſupply of an omiſſion in the foregoing chapter; therefore I will not much inſiſt upon it, but yet muſt needs put them in mind of that pat and pertinent place, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 44.25. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord that fruſtrateth the takens of the liers, and maketh diviners mad,</hi> &amp;c. v. 26. <hi>That ſaith unto Jeruſalem, thou ſhalt be inhabited, and to the Cities of Judah ye ſhall be built, and I will raiſe up the decayed places thereof:</hi> v. 28. <hi>That ſaith unto Cyrus, he is my ſhepherd, and ſhall perform all my pleaſure, even ſaying to Jeruſalem, thou ſhalt be built; and to the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple thy foundation ſhall be laid.</hi> The Diviners ſeem in this place to be called lyars for that very reaſon, becauſe they did prophecy <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſhould not be rebuilt (flattering the Babyloniſh monarchy, as if that ſhould always laſt) whereas God had purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to raiſe it up again. I would wiſh thoſe great deciers (viz. of future contingencies) for ſo the name given to Aſtrologers <hi>Iſa.</hi> 47.13. doth ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie) to read that chapter alſo, and their doom in it: methinks ever ſince black Munday (as they called it) only black to the Aſtrologers themſelves as I remember, by fruſtrating their predictions) that ſort of men ſhould learn to be more modeſt and not bear the world in hand, as if they were Secretaries of Heaven, or of the Almighty his privy counſel, which I no more believe then I do the vaporing of ſome of their brethren who pretend to certain rules of their art (as <hi>Tully</hi> reporteth) of
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:45718:41"/>forty thouſand, yet ſome of ſeventy thouſand years ſtanding, whereas for many thouſand years ſince that (the world being not yet ſix thouſand years old (there were neither ſtars to obſerve, nor men to obſerve them.</p>
            <p>But to return to the buſineſs in hand, I wiſh it were put to the vote of all the people in <hi>England,</hi> whether it be, or be not of great importance that <hi>London</hi> ſhould be rebuilded.

                  <hi>That it is convenient the re-edifying of London ſhould be with all poſſible ſpeed and expedition.</hi>
               </p>
            </argument>
            <p>I Shall not compare the kindneſſes we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from our Superiours, one with another (ſith compariſons as they ſay, are odious) but ſure I am, they have not been more acknowledg'd, and thank'd for any thing they have done, than for their prudent Act for, and concerning the rebuild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>London:</hi> nor do I think there is any thing in that Act more thank-worthy, than the zeal they have expreſſed for the diſpatch of that work, by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:45718:41"/>under a great penalty, that every houſe ſhould be rebuilt within the ſpace of three years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the date thereof, (<hi>pag.</hi> 94.) though I doubt not but if that ſhall prove morally impoſſible to ſome, though not to all; they in their wiſdom, and clememcy will hereafter allow as much more time, as ſhall be thought abſolutely neceſſary.</p>
            <p>Now if any man ſhall think it was more than needed, to quicken men to a work, to which their own intereſt, and inclination, might ſo much prompt them; I muſt crave leave to diſſent, and to tell them that the dull minds of men had need to be ſtirred up by more than Ceremonies, to thoſe things in which they are greatly concerned, wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs <hi>Lot</hi> himſelf, of whom it is ſaid, <hi>that whilſt he lingred</hi> (which was whilſt the Flames of <hi>Sodom</hi> were purſuing him) <hi>the men laid hold upon his hand (the Lord being merciful to him) and they brought him forth and ſet him without the City,</hi> Gen. 19.16.</p>
            <p>I cannot but judge that the rebuilding of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> calls for expedition, when I conſider, how the burning Feaver which befel <hi>London</hi> in the year 66. was not the firſt fit of ſickneſs it had lately been viſited with, but a ſore relapſe, after it was newly (and but ſcarce) recovered out of other great, and dangerous maladies; not only accute, but chronical: who knows not that <hi>London</hi> had for many months together been brought even to deaths door with the Plague, and that it had loſt abundance of blood, both red, white, and yellow, with a waſting War; inſomuch that its great Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitians, have ſaid long ſince, that both it, and the whole Kingdom, were in a deep Conſumption. Not to recite all its Diſeaſes, though I might name the Scurvey, Hypocondriacal Melancholly, and ſeveral others, which it is full of. Now this Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenture,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:45718:42"/>(the Fire I mean) coming after all the reſt, hath brought it ſo very low, (together with the whole Nation) that without ſome ſtrong Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dials, and powerful Reſtauratives, ſpeedily admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred, it cannot long ſubſiſt.</p>
            <p>It cannot be forgotten, that <hi>London</hi> was but three or four daies a burning, and why ſhould that which was deſtroyed in three or four daies, be longer in building and reſtoring than three, or four years, (provided it can be done in that time.) If I miſtake not, I have heard of a Wall of great length, and circumference, which is about the great Houſe in <hi>Oſterley</hi> Park, that it was built in one nights time, by the help of an incredible number of Work-men, that were ſummoned in for that purpoſe, to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and amuſe Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> who was there at that time, and knew not of the beginning of it, till ſhe ſaw it finiſhed; I am not certain of the ſtory, but am ſure our Proverb is true, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>many hands make light work,</hi> and though <hi>Rome</hi> were not built in one day, neither can <hi>London</hi> be; yet if Work-men from all parts, were commanded to give their attendance upon that buſineſs, and upon nothing elſe, but what were of abſolute neceſſity, till that were finiſhed, <hi>London</hi> would go up amain, and appear ſomething like a City in a little time. Alas! Poor Citizens long to be ſettled once again, and to fall to their reſpective Trades, as formerly, making a hard ſhift mean time; and pity it is, that whilſt the graſs is growing the Steeds ſhould ſtarve; that whilſt the City is raiſing, the Citizens in the interim ſhould be ruined. Therefore it is I ſo much preſs for expedition.</p>
            <p>If our Governours would encourage the import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of all neceſſary materials, from forreign parts, (as I hear they intend) it would be a good, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:45718:42"/>work, and nothing could carry a greater ſhow of love and good will to that poor City, than that will do (which will never think it ſelf beloved, unleſs its reſtauration be promoted, by them that have power to do it.)</p>
            <p>And ſith the great want of money is (as I am told) like to be the main hindrance of the rebuild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>London,</hi> how do I wiſh that Uſurers, and all other great moneyed men, would bring forth their bags, and chearfully lend to Citizens for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes of building, ſecuring themſelves by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, and taking no other advantage when that is done.</p>
            <p>Did all men long, as I think I long, to ſee ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>London</hi> (though I have little intereſt in it to what it hath in me) (and I think all <hi>Engliſh</hi> men ſhould long for it as much as I do) I perſwade my ſelf, ſuch treaſure, and ſuch aſſiſtance in every kind, would be brought in towards it, as would make a very quick diſpatch even of ſo great a work.</p>
            <p>But leſt I my ſelf be tedious, whilſt I plead for others to uſe expedition, I ſhall conclude this Chapter, with what a Heatheniſh King gave in charge about the Temple of God at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> (and their good Example will moſt of all condemn us Chriſtians if we fall ſhort of it) <hi>And I</hi> Artaxerxes <hi>do make a Decree to all the Treaſurers beyond the River, that whatſoever</hi> Ezra <hi>ſhall require of you, it be done ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily,</hi> Ezra 7.21.</p>

                  <hi>Of Building upon all the Ruines of the City with Brick (as is injoyned.)</hi>
               </p>
            </argument>
            <p>I Hope it was not for ſtate, but for ſecurity; not out of pride, but prudence; not for pomp, but for preſervation; that it was injoyned, that ſo much of <hi>London</hi> as was burnt, ſhould be built again all with Brick: For was not God very angry with thoſe that ſaid <hi>in the ſtoutneſs of their hearts; The Bricks are fallen down, but we well build with hewen ſtones; the Sycamores are cut down, but we will change them into Cedars;</hi> Iſa. 9. v. 10, <hi>Therefore the Lord ſhall ſet up the Adverſaries of</hi> Rezin <hi>againſt him, and joyn his enemies together,</hi> verſ. 11. And were it not as great a crime to ſay, in a way of ſtoutneſs, the Rafters are fallen down, but we will build with Bricks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But as I ſaid before, ſo I am in the ſame mind, that this was appointed in order to ſafety, rather than to ſtate, and magnificence: And verily expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience hath told us that Brick-buildings are in an ordinary way much more ſecure from the danger of Fire, than ſuch as conſiſt of much Wood and Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber: Witneſs thoſe Skeletons of Brick-Houſes, which we ſee ſtanding ſince our dreadful Fire, which though it pickt out the Marrow (as I may call their inſides, yet could not digeſt the bones, though it devoured the kernel of ſuch Houſes, could not quite deſtroy their ſhells: whereas it made no bones (as we ſpeak Proverbially) of timber Houſes, but conſumed them intirely, and have left us nothing of them, but the excrements of Fire (ſo fed) I mean, duſt and and aſhes.</p>
            <pb n="49" facs="tcp:45718:43"/>
            <p>Now all ſuch beauty and decency; as is the mere reſult and product of what is otherwiſe good, and neceſſary (like ſhadows that follow ſubſtances, or honour conſequent upon virtue) is no offence to God, and ſhould be none to men. Whatſoever is in all reſpects as is naturally behoofeful and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, for it to be, cannot likely want ſome degree of handſomeneſſe.

            <p>And ſo it fareth with the Exerciſes and Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Religion, where all the ſubſtantials there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of meet together; as namely, when the Word of God is read to the people, gravely, diſtinctly, and devoutly; when the Miniſter preacheth ſoundly, and ſavourily, in the evidence and demonſtration of the Spirit; when he prayeth ſolidly, methodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally, ſpiritually, and affectionately; when the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple do hear, and joyn reverently, and attentively; I ſay, where theſe things meet, there doth unavoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dably reſult abundance of decency, and ſolemnity, and ſuch, as if one that <hi>believeth not, or is unlearned, ſhall come in, may cauſe him to be convinced of all, and judged of all, and to fall down and worſhip God, reporting that God is in them of a truth,</hi> as it is in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.23. where all the Order the Apoſtle preſcribeth is, <hi>that all things be done to edifying,</hi> verſe 26. <hi>that Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men keep ſilence in the Church,</hi> verſe 34. <hi>that ſuch as are fit to Propheſie ſhould Propheſie but one, by one, and the reſt hold their peace,</hi> verſe 31. <hi>and that the ſpirits of the Prophets ſhould be ſubject to the Prophets,</hi> ver. 32. and ſuch like things which are not arbitrary, but in their own nature neceſſary, and without which, in the judgement of all men, there would be meere confuſion.</p>

            <p>And of that Reſurrection alſo, may our City when it ſhall be all of Brick put us in mind, for then, after <hi>ſo great a death,</hi> as it had by the Fire, will it riſe again, much more handſom, and beautiful, than it was before; So ſhall the bodies of Believers, <hi>which having been ſown in corruption ſhall be raiſed in incorruption, and having been ſown in weakneſs ſhall riſe in power,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. <hi>and ſhall be made like to the glorious body of Chriſt.</hi> though before they were vile bodies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

From the dirty, dungy, deſpiſed Earth, have we meat, drink, ſauce, corn, wine, oyl, linnen (which we muſt cloath our ſelves with whilſt we live) and amongſt other things the very houſes we do, and muſt dwell in, as well living as dead. I write not this to make my ſelf and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers more in love with this Earth (which we are

            </p>
            <p>Can we behold thoſe Bricks which our houſes are, and muſt be made of, and not look back upon that ſad trade which the poor <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were made to follow in <hi>Egypt, viz.</hi> of making Bricks, a double tale of Brick, yea without ſtraw too (ſave what was of their own gathering) and can we chuſe but think of the parallel caſe of all ſuch poor Citizens, as have houſes to build at almoſt a double charge, but not wherewithal to do it?

               <p>
                  <hi>Of ill burnt Bricks, and that great care ſhould be taken to build the New City with good Materials.</hi>
               </p>
            </argument>
            <p>WIll any traſh ſerve for the building of our new City? was <hi>London</hi> ſo lately deſtroyed by the burning of its materials, and ſhall it quickly be deſtroyed again for want of materials (that is Bricks) duly burnt? Do we look for another Fire to burn our Bricks over again? It is ſaid of <hi>Ephra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>im, Hoſ.</hi> 7.8. Ephraim <hi>is a Cake not turned,</hi> meaning not throughly baked; that was ſpoken in a myſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and ſhall the ſame be true of <hi>London</hi> in a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanical ſenſe? Why do men make more haſt than good ſpeed? either build as may laſt, or not at all. If they that have Bricks to ſell have no more Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience than to offer ſuch as are ſtark naught, you that are to buy ſhould have more care and diſcretion than to accept of them.</p>
            <p>Is it for cheapneſs ſake that you make uſe of ſuch unfit Commodities? then are you <hi>penny-wiſe and pound-fooliſh.</hi> I ſee no men are ſuch loſers as they that are over-ſaving, none ſo prodigal (though ſore againſt their wills) as are the greateſt miſers. So ſome men ſue at the Law for great things, which they juſtly claim, and loſe their cauſe by ſtarving it; and others, when ſick, neglect advice, and dye as it were to ſave charges. To ſuch our homely Proverb is but too applicable, <hi>They will loſe a ſheep to ſave a half-peny-worth of Tar;</hi> but that of <hi>Solomon</hi> is much better. <hi>There is that with-holdeth what is meet, and it turneth to poverty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They ſay that Bricks were never worſe than they have bin of late, and yet never dearer. And it is
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:45718:46"/>an ordinary caſe, for things when they are of leaſt worth and value, to be of greateſt price. Thus ſome people who pay the moſt Tythes have the worſt Preaching, and ſome of the richeſt Benefices are worſt ſupplied; Yea, thus ſome give themſelves more coſt and pains to ruine ſouls, and conſequently their own, <hi>(Compaſſing Sea and Land to make men more the children of the Devil)</hi> than others do to ſave the Souls of themſelves and others. Alas that the worſt things ſhould coſt moſt, or that men ſhould give a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing for that which is ſtark naught (like unſavory Salt fit for nothing but the dunghill) and that men ſhould not rather ſay as one did in another caſe <hi>non emam tanti poenitere,</hi> They will not give ſo dear for what they ſhall afterwards repent of.</p>
            <p>They that take bad Bricks, do in effect make them (or are as bad as them that do, as we ſay <hi>The receiver is as bad as the Thief</hi>) for if none would buy thoſe Bricks that were ſuch, no ſuch would be made for ſale. This were the way to make all traders ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, <hi>viz.</hi> to take nothing off their hands but what were good, and to that end to adviſe with thoſe that have judgment in ſuch things in caſe we have none our ſelves. Some things we ſay are good of the price, but other things are good at no price, becauſe good for nothing, and ſo are bad Bricks as for the purpoſes of Building.</p>
            <p>Have Magiſtrates taken care to ſtop one leak by ordering we ſhould build with brick, and will we ſpring another? have they appointed us a good kind of Materials, and will we not take that which is good in its kind? Surely good timber is better to build with than bad brick (as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>A living d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>g is better than a dead Li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n),</hi> for the firſt will not preſently decay, without Fire befall it, but the other will of its own accord, and ſuffer as much injury
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:45718:46"/>from ſucceſſive Froſts, and thaws (which come of courſe) as the latter ſhall by fire it ſelf, which may not happen in an age.</p>
            <p>I foreſee the fate of thoſe unhappy houſes that have been built with ill burnt bricks, that ſhortly they will molder away to duſt, (and ſo I hear that ſome of them have begun to do already.) The like (if my Prognoſticks fail me not) will likewiſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall thoſe Societies both Eccleſiaſtical and Civil, which are conſtituted of ill members, (Principal ones eſpecially) which are as ſo many bad and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerviceable bricks in houſes. Such Societies, like ſuch houſes, probably cannot ſtand long.</p>
            <p>I much ſuſpect the ſame fate will befall a great part of the young Generation that is now ſpringing up, <hi>viz.</hi> that in a few years they will crumble a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way like houſes built with ill burnt bricks, (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering how vicious the preſent age is). For who can bring a ſound thing out of that which is unſound, any more than a clean thing out of that which is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean? where the bones are rotten the Marrow will be filthy, and the product of it will be more of that which is rotten: which notion is more proper to be here inſerted, becauſe that Generation in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, is called the building up of a houſe, and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are called <hi>Banim</hi> from an Hebrew root which ſignifieth to build.</p>
            <p>Our ill burnt Bricks are methinks the ſad em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blem of one thing more, and that is of all ſuch Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors who have been meerly ſinged and ſcorched with the ſlender heat of ſome overly convictions, but were never brought to a due firmneſs or conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence, by lying long enough in and under that Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace which the Scripture calleth <hi>a Spirit of bondage.</hi> Such may be laid into the building of the Church, but will ſcarcely hold out.</p>
            <pb n="56" facs="tcp:45718:47"/>
            <p>But whilſt I caution againſt bad bricks, I would caution as much againſt bad timber, as namely ſuch as hath been ſeared and overdried by the fire; and no leſs againſt bad mortar. For to <hi>dawbe with untempered mortar,</hi> cannot be ſafe; mortar being that to a houſe, which love is to a ſociety, <hi>viz.</hi> That which binds, and cements all together.</p>
            <p>Surely <hi>England</hi> doth not want for good materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als within it ſelf, but if the daughters will not be kind to their mother (that is if other parts of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> will not be kind to <hi>London,</hi> their mother City) we being now at peace with many nations that can furniſh us for building purpoſes, and having ſtore of nimble meſſengers, that can fly about the world, upon the wings of the wind, and fetch home great burthens (as our ſhips are) ſhould for <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons</hi> uſe, have enough of brick, timber, and every thing elſe, and that good and cheap enough; if it be to be had in Chriſtendom.</p>

                  <hi>Of its being intended that the new Buildings ſhould be more magnificent then were the old.</hi>

The ſecond Temple, for matter of outward ſplendor, was not comparable to the firſt, which made the old men weep that had ſeen them both. Is this to humble our ſelves under the mighty hand of God? is this to accept the puniſhment of our iniquity? is this to lay our mouths in the duſt, if there may be hope?
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:45718:47"/>or is not this to ſay we will have beauty for aſhes, we will build our neſts on high; though God hath laid us lower then ever, or is not this to do like the Jews of old, who when called of God <hi>to weeping, mourning, baldneſs, and To girding with ſackcloath, fell to ſhaying of Oxen, killing of Sheep, drinking wine, &amp;c.</hi> Iſa. 22.12, 13. <hi>Which iniquity</hi> God ſaid <hi>ſhould not be purged from them till they died:</hi> that is, were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, v. 14.</p>
            <p>Were this ſaid in the pride, and ſtoutneſs of our hearts, that we would have another City more beautiful then the former (as they of <hi>Samaria</hi> are challenged by God to have ſaid in the pride of their hearts) <hi>The bricks are fallen down, but we will build with ſtone, Iſa.</hi> 9.10. There were no excuſing it, yea ſome great Judgment might be exſpected to inſue it, but the greater ſtatelineſs of the new City then of the old, I take to be rather <hi>finis operis</hi> then <hi>finis operantis,</hi> that is to ſay, the effect of ſome other, and more neceſſary thing, which was primarily, if not only deſigned, then any thing contrived, by and for its ſelf.</p>
            <p>I have ſaid already, that the law for building only with brick, was in order to greater ſecurity, and indemnity from fire. Then, as for making ſeveral ſtreets broader then they were before, that the great, and many inconveniences, which were formerly found in and by the narrowneſs of <hi>Thames Street,</hi> and ſome others, may ſatisfie any man, was but expedient, and neceſſary. And whereas ſome may think the new houſes carry, and are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to carry, their heads too high, and riſe up to a greater altitude, then doth become them, after ſo humbling a judgment, good reaſon may be aſſigned for that, <hi>viz.</hi> That it was enacted they ſhould do ſo in order to the gaining of more room, and
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:45718:48"/>that ſo much the rather, becauſe a great deal of room hath, and will be loſt otherwiſe, by the new model of the City, and particularly, by widening of the ſtreets, thoſe Latitudinarian ſtreets (if I may ſo call them) inforcing as it were altitudinarian houſes.</p>
            <p>Now from the three forementioned cauſes, <hi>viz.</hi> The buildings being of brick, the breadth of the Streets, and the height of the houſes greater then formerly: thence I ſay principally, if not only, will ſpring that beauty and luſtre, which the new City, or the major part of it, is like to have above the old, all which things being neceſſary for other reaſons, and having been done upon their account, ought at no hand to be found fault with.</p>
            <p>As men may faſt and mourn <hi>and</hi> yet <hi>not disfigure their countenances whereby to appear to men to faſt, but may anoint their heads</hi> (that day) <hi>and waſh their faces:</hi> and Chriſt commendeth ſo doing, as beſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.16. So may the outward viſage of our City be hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, and beautiful, and yet we our ſelves never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs truly ſenſible both of our ſins and miſeries.</p>
            <p>I Should think a City of <hi>London,</hi> outwardly more ſplendid then ever, might in ſome reſpects increaſe our humiliation, rather then inflame our pride, even as a poor man, clad in a rich habit, might from thence have more ſad, and frequent reflections upon his poverty, as thinking with himſelf how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſutable the fineneſs of his outward garb, is to the meanneſs of his condition, and how much other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it is really with him, then by his habit ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers would take it to be.</p>
            <p>But that a ſtately City, raiſed in a ſhort time out of a ruinous heap, might conduce to ſtirr up in us more of thankfulneſs, and admiration of Gods goodneſs, I ſee not who can deny: <hi>with this ſtaff</hi> (ſaid
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:45718:48"/>
               <hi>Jacob) paſſed I over Jordan, and now the Lord hath made me two bands, Gen.</hi> 32.10. Which ſurely he acknowledged, with more thankfulneſs, and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, then he would have done; if God had made him but one band, no bigger then either of his two</p>
            <p>Moreover another <hi>London</hi> more magnificent then the former, how great an eye ſore would it be to the enemies of that City; who moſt barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly rejoyced at its flames, and triumphed at its funeral, and would (if they knew how) have rol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led ſo great a ſtone over its grave, that it ſhould never have been capable of riſing again? I ſay when thoſe envious perſons, ſhall come to ſee two ſtaffes in the hand of <hi>London,</hi> viz. <hi>Beauty and Bands</hi> (that is State, and Strength) alluding to <hi>Zech.</hi> 11.) neither of which they exſpected: how will that ſight abate their pride, confront their malice, and confound their devices.</p>
            <p>Laſtly a ſtately City ſhould methinks provoke the inhabitants to a generous emulation, of being ſo wealthy, and ſubſtantial, as by it they ſeem or make ſhew to be. If ſo goodly a City be to <hi>Londo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,</hi> at the firſt erecting of it, like a garment that is much to big for him that weareth it, yet may it put them upon indeavouring to grow ſo faſt, that it may be fit for them, if it be to them, <hi>as raiment of needle work, or of wrought gold;</hi> ſuch as the Kings Daughter is ſaid to be, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 45.13. may it not ſtirr them up to be like her <hi>all glorious within:</hi> that their inſide and outſide may well agree together?</p>

            <p>WOrkmen do your office, and do it like workmen that need not to be aſhamed, and like honeſt men. If you take building by the great, make no more haſt with it then good ſpeed; but if you take it by the day, make as much haſt as will conſiſt with good ſpeed. Do by <hi>Londoners</hi> as you would be done by, build for them as you would build for your ſelves: we may have a noble City (God permitting) if you will but play your parts.</p>
            <p>Make no more faults then you needs muſt, that you may make work for your ſelves to mend thoſe faults which you have wilfully made, and put thoſe you build for, to a greater charge and trouble.

            <p>As for thoſe, who ſhall have the cuſtom of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doners</hi> for Bricks, Tiles, Timber, Glaſſe, Lead, I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron, and other materials which concern building, I conjure them by all that is worthy, as they pretend to any thing of Chriſtiantity, or of humanity, to uſe them kindly after ſo great a calamity as hath befallen them: Give them their full quantity of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing they bargain for, and let them have that which is truely good, and at as low a price as you can afford: Rather wrong your ſelves, than wrong them who have ſuffered ſo many things already,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:45718:50"/>rather loſe, than gain too much by them; and yet I would wiſh you not to do that neither; Let it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be ſaid that you were raiſed by the Ruines of <hi>London,</hi> or that the impoveriſhing of that City, was that which made you rich, unleſſe you can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come rich, by a very ſmall, and ſlender profit out of each commodity.</p>
            <p>If you be <hi>Engliſh</hi>-men <hi>London</hi> is your Mother, (as <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was the Mother of the <hi>Jews,</hi> which are called the Daughters of <hi>Jeruſalem Cant.</hi> 1.5.) and conſequently <hi>Londoners</hi> are your Brethren, and will you not uſe them as ſuch.</p>

            <p>I Hear that ſome have borrowed without leave, (if that may be called borrowing) that is of ſome who have taken their neighbours Bricks, and other materials, which lay near to their own Ruines, and have built their houſes with them, as confidently as if they had been their own. Do ſuch men think that the Fire hath made all things common; that it did or could (Leveller-like) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy all propriety (and that not only <hi>de facto,</hi> but <hi>de jure;</hi>) Is now all your own you can lay hands upon? and doth every thing of right belong <hi>primum occupanti,</hi> to him that can firſt get it into his poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion? Nay ſurely, it is rather a kind of ſacriledge to take from men what the Fire had left them, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as the reliques of the Fire, may in ſome ſenſe be accounted Sacred, and a kind of <hi>Deodates,</hi> or things vouchſafed us, or reſerved for us by God immediately. He hath a hard heart who grudgeth any man that ſmall Legacy, or Remainder of any thing which that moſt cruel Fire left him, when it dyed, or went out; That took away your neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor's Vintage, and will you grudge them the Glea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of their own ground? Behold! Theft upon Theft, and that is the falſeſt Heraldry that can be. Citizens were Robbed when their houſes were burning, and now that they would build their hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, they are robb'd again.</p>
            <p>You cannot think that your Neighbors Bricks and other materials have ſo far treſpaſſed by lying near to yours, that you may lawfully pound them,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:45718:51"/>in your own houſes from whence they are never like to be releaſed? if he had took your materials as you did his, how would you have taken it at his hands? would you have put it up quietly?</p>
            <p>In <hi>Jer.</hi> 23.30. it is written, <hi>Behold I am againſt the Prophets ſaith the Lord that ſteal my Word every one from his Neighbor.</hi> Was God againſt thoſe Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al builders (for ſo are Prophets) which ſtole his Word from one another as <hi>Hananiah</hi> did from <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remiah,</hi> uſing the ſame words, though to other pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, &amp;c.</hi> (Jer. 28.2. compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with <hi>Jer.</hi> 49.1. and 37.) taking the very words out of <hi>Jeremiahs</hi> mouth, &amp;c. How much more will he be againſt thoſe temporal builders, which ſteal away each others Materials, becauſe theſe latter can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not both make uſe of the ſame Materials at the ſame time, but that the former (<hi>viz.</hi> the Prophets) might have done, two of them might have ſpoken the ſame thing at the ſame time, but two houſes can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be built with the ſame numerical Bricks, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Think of a few paſſages in <hi>Habbakkuk</hi> 2. v. 6. <hi>We to him that increaſeth that which is not his. How long? and that ladeth himſelf with thick Clay,</hi> which words are literally applicable to thoſe that build with bricks which are not their own, ver. 9. <hi>Wo to him that covet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth an evil covetouſneſs to his houſe, that he may ſet his neſt on high,</hi> v. 10. Thou haſt conſulted ſhame to thy houſe, v. 11. <hi>For the ſtones ſhall cry out of the Wall, and the beam out of the Timber ſhall anſwer it,</hi> ver. 12. <hi>Wo to him that eſtabliſheth a City by iniquity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Suppoſe the greater part of your materials were honeſtly come by, even nineteen parts in twenty, but a twentieth part, or ſome much leſs proportion, were got by ſtealth, it is greatly to be feared and verily to be expected, that even ſo ſmall a pittance of that which was ſtollen, will go nigh to ruine all
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:45718:51"/>the reſt, if ſatisfaction be not timely made for the injury done, and the ſin repented of, (as <hi>Gideon</hi> his one only baſtard deſtroyed his 70 ſons that were lawfully begotten, <hi>Judg</hi> 9.5.</p>
            <p>Therefore my advice in ſhort is this, If thou haſt made uſe of any part of thy Neighbours Materials unwittingly, and afterwards doſt come to know it, ſatisfy him for the principal, and tender him a fifth part over, and above (if he pleaſe to accept it) for ſo was the Law of Reſtitution in caſe of unwilful in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury, <hi>Numb.</hi> 5.7. but if thou have taken any thing from him knowingly, offer him five for one (if thou art able ſo to do) for ſo was provided under the Law, if any man did injure another wilfully, <hi>Exod.</hi> 22.1. When thou art in thy Belcony, or at the top of thy high houſe think of <hi>Zachaeus</hi> in the Sycamore-Tree, and of what he ſaid, (though not there) <hi>If I have taken any thing from any man falſly, I will reſtore him fourfold,</hi> Luke 14.8.</p>

               </p>
            </argument>
            <p>THe Lords Day is not that Sabbath which was firſt ſo called, for that was the laſt day of the week, whereas it is the firſt; yet a Sabbath it is, and doubtleſs injoyned, in, and by the ſame Commandment that the Jewiſh Sabbath was, <hi>viz.</hi> the fourth; for whoſoever doth not acknowledge it ſo to be, muſt either ſay that there is no Sabbath at all, or day of holy reſt to be kept under the New Teſtament, and conſequently, that there are now
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:45718:53"/>but nine Commandments in the Moral Law, the fourth being abrogated and expired; whereas Chriſt hath told us, <hi>That till heaven and earth paſs, one jot ſhall in no wiſe paſs from that Law,</hi> Mat. 5.18. or elſe they muſt ſay, that the laſt day of the week is that which ought alwayes to be obſerved by Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans (as it is by Jews) for the only Sabbath, and weekly holy day, that is for ever to be celebrated in obedience to that Command. Moſt Chriſtians are averſe from Judaizing, in taking Saturday for their Sabbath, chuſing rather to imitate the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of the Apoſtles, whoſe manner it was to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve not the laſt, but firſt day of the week, which we conclude they would not have done, but by Warrantie and Commiſſion from Chriſt (who alone was <hi>Lord of the Sabbath</hi>) ſo to do.</p>
            <p>Yet ſome few Chriſtians there are, who ſymbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lize with the Jews in their Saturday-Sabbath, and keep the ſame day as holy as they can: And verily (if in this caſe I may ſpeak my mind freely) they are much leſs too blame who keep a Saturday Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, than they who keep none at all; who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that Commandment as the Jews do, than they who make as if it were abrogated and diſannul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.</p>
            <p>But he that ſhall fall into neither of the extremes aforeſaid, but ſhall confeſs that the firſt day of the week is that which was inſtituted for Chriſtians by the fourth Commandment, muſt needs own it to be a Sabbath, becauſe inſtituted and appointed by and under that name, Exod. 20.8. <hi>Remember the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day to keep it holy:</hi> and v. 11. <hi>The Lord bleſſed the Sabbath day, and hallowed it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That it was neceſſary I ſhould prove there is a Sabbath yet in being, and that the day which men ought weekly to obſerve as holy to the Lord, tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughout
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:45718:53"/>all Ages, is called the Sabbath, to the end I might ſhew that the Promiſes made, and incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements given to ſuch as have kept, or ſhall keep holy the Sabbath day, are not inſignificant, and out of date, as to us, who live under the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>Having done that, it will be eaſie to prove what I have affirmed in the Title of this Chapter, <hi>viz.</hi> that a ſtrict obſervation of the Sabbath (for ſo is the Lords day to Chriſtians) would greatly promote the building of the City; witneſs that pregnant promiſe, which of its ſelf were a ſufficient teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, Iſa. 58.12, 13. <hi>And they that ſhall be of thee, ſhall build the waſt places, thou ſhalt raiſe up the foundations of many generations, and thou ſhalt be called the repairer of the breach, and reſtorer of paths to dwell in: If thou turn away thy foot from my Sabbath, from doing thy plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure on my holy day, and call the Sabbath a delight, the holy of the Lord, honourable, and ſhalt honour him, not doing thine own wayes, nor finding thine own pleaſure, nor ſpeaking thine own words,</hi> v. 14. <hi>I will cauſe thee to ride upon the high places of the earth;</hi> (that is, to dwell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loft in places of ſecurity and ſafety) or the words may glance at the Land of <hi>Judea,</hi> being much of it Mountainous, <hi>and feed thee with the Heritage of</hi> Jacob <hi>thy Father;</hi> that is, with the good things of the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>From thoſe Texts I infer, that unto keeping the Sabbath, ſeveral promiſes of God, building and bleſſing of Cities, and furniſhing men with deſira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble habitations are made; as on the other hand, the profaning and polluting of the Sabbath is threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, with the deſtruction of Cities, and of their Inhabitants; which being true in the general, or in <hi>theſi,</hi> it muſt needs be in <hi>hypotheſi,</hi> or in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, that a Religious obſervation of the Sabbath day would help to build our City.</p>
            <p>Who knows not that <hi>Nehemiah</hi> was a great and principal Agent in the building of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> after it was burnt, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 2.5. and what Magiſtrate was ever more zealous than he (if ſo zealous) to have the Sabbath day kept holy? witneſs his contending with Merchants, and Tradeſmen of all ſorts; yea, with the <hi>very Nobles of Judah,</hi> for profaning the Sabbath, <hi>Nehemiah</hi> 13. from 15. to v. 22. <hi>Did not your Fathers thus</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>to the Nobles? and did not our God bring all this evil upon us, and upon our City,</hi> viz. deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by fire, <hi>yet ye bring more wrath upon</hi> Iſrael <hi>by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faning the Sabbath.</hi> If profanation of Sabbaths pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the burning of Cities, the ſanctification of that day will promote the building thereof.</p>
            <p>It is ſaid, <hi>Eadem eſt ratio loci &amp; temporis;</hi> time and place are much akin; if we would have regard to Gods time, he would have reſpect to our place, or places; if we would mind his day, would he not mind our dwellings? the ſanctifying of Sabbaths, is the intruſting of God with the ſeventh part of our time (even then when time is moſt precious with us) Now God is alwayes bountiful to them that do greatly truſt him, Mal. 3.10. <hi>Bring all the tithes into the Storehouſe, and prove me therewith, ſaith the Lord, if I will not poure you out a bleſſing, that there ſhall not be room enough to receive it;</hi> as if God had ſaid, Do
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:45718:54"/>but truſt me with the tenth part of the encreaſe, and you ſhall ſee what the other nine ſhall amount to. If we in like manner would truſt God with the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth part of our time (for ſo our Sabbaths are) doubtleſſe the other ſix would through the bleſſing of God, turn to a much better account.</p>
            <p>I doubt not to ſay that one day in ſeven (that is, every Lords day) we might promote the building of <hi>London,</hi> much more in Churches and Cloſets, than we could do in working upon the reſpective foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations, for that indeed would ſet it back, and might provoke God to ſwear in his Wrath, it ſhould never be brought to perfection.</p>
            <p>I obſerve what is ſaid of <hi>Manna,</hi> Exod. 16.29. <hi>The Lord hath given you the Sabbath, therefore he giveth you on the ſixth day, the bread of two daies, let no man go out of his place on the ſeventh day,</hi> viz. to gather <hi>Manna.</hi> God made them amends for forbearing to progue on the Sabbath-day.</p>

<pb n="72" facs="tcp:45718:55"/>ought to be, are no loſſe, but the moſt profitable part of time.</p>
            <p>But alas, we ſo carry the matter as to loſe a great part of that hallowed time, which is of all our time moſt precious, making holyday of a great part thereof, in ſuch ſenſe, as Children do underſtand holy-daies; <hi>viz.</hi> as meer paſtimes and play-daies; I fear we begin our Sabbaths too late, and end them too early; we do not remember the Sabbath ſoon enough to keep it holy as we ſhould, and we for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get it too ſoon, we are not intent enough, either upon preparation before, or proſecution after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. The Sabbaths which men generally keep now a daies, are not only unlike to thoſe of glorious Saints and Angels in Heaven, but to ſuch as were kept by thoſe good Chriſtians, whom ſome intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to reproach by fixing upon them the honourable name of Puritans, which ſort of men, I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber one that was none of them himſelf, had wont to divide into two ranks, ſaying, there was the <hi>Knave Puritan</hi> (that is one, that was ſo but in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, and for a colour) and there was the <hi>Knave's Puritan,</hi> whom he confeſſed to be a very honeſt man, and of an excellent ſort) but out of malice called a Puritan by ſuch as were Knaves themſelves; becauſe that to ſuch as themſelves, the Name was odious; though both Name, and Perſon were ſo only for their goodneſs. Now having heard a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction to that effect, I muſt explain my ſelf, and tell you that it was the <hi>Knave's Puritan</hi> (that is, he, and ſuch as he, whom Knaves had wont to call ſo) of whom I affirm, that he had wont to keep Sabbaths at anotherguiſe rate, than we obſerve them kept now a daies, (ſuch as Reverend <hi>Dod, Hilderſham,</hi> &amp;c.) and yet they were not upon their good be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour (as we are) for the building a poor City ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:45718:55"/>in aſhes. They would have bluſht to have ſeen our Sabbaths; Oh that we could bluſh to think of them: they would ſcarce have been able to think us ſincere Chriſtians, obſerving us to have ſo ſmall a regard to the fourth Commandement; They would have often rebuked us ſharply, for our Sabbath-daies diſcourſe, and minded us of the Text that ſaith, we ſhould not ſpeak our own words on the Lords day, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 58. when in this reſpect ſhall we be followers of thoſe worthies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid, who now inherit the Promiſes? A City, the greater part of whoſe former Inhabitants were ſuch Sanctifiers of Gods Sabbaths as they were, would certainly not long lye in Aſhes, but God would cauſe the waſt places thereof to be built. Alas that now our City is down in the duſt, ſuch Maſter-buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders as they (in the ſenſe I have ſpoken to) are dead, and gone.</p>
            <p>I wonder not that ſuch as are enemies to Religion, have a particular grudge againſt the Sanctifying of the Sabbath, or appointing it to be ſanctified, ſith the preſervation of all practical godlineſs (ſo far as is in men to preſerve it) doth ſo much depend there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon. For alas what time have men and women, who lye down late, and riſe up early, all the week long, to get their livings (as the greater part of people do) I ſay, what time could, or would they generally reſerve to look after God, and their ſouls, if it were not for the Lords Day, preſerved by the ſanction of the Magiſtrate from violation, by mens open following of their Trades, and deſigned for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious uſes.</p>
            <p>But it is not the common-place of the Sabbath that I undertook to handle in this Chapter, but what, and how great a tendency, a due care taken both by Magiſtrates, and people, for the Sanctification
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:45718:56"/>of that day, would have to promote the building of our City, and that I hope I have demonſtrated.</p>

Some have great Eſtates and no Children, others have great Eſtates and Children; but not worthy to be intruſted with ſuch Eſtates; ſome have been great gainers by the late revolutions, yea ſome by thoſe very judgments which have of late befallen us, even by the fire it's ſelf (which did not only ſpare their houſes, but much advance their rents) though thouſands may have need to ſell what they are poſſeſſed of, yet ſome hundreds (I believe) are ready for conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable purchaſes, and have ſuch perſons as I have named, nothing to ſpare, for, and towards, the rebuilding of ſuch a City? are they like to give any thing to any good uſes (living, or dying) who will give nothing to this. If mens gold and ſilver lye cankered by them: whilſt there is ſuch an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to lay it out, ſhall not <hi>the ruſt thereof be a witneſs
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:45718:56"/>againſt them, and eat their fleſh as it were fire,</hi> James. 5.33. Who wonders not (as the caſe now-ſtands) to ſee any rich man dye, and leave nothing to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> in his will? many places that are burnt down, were built by charity at the firſt, and muſt be ſo again if ever they be reſtored; and many perſons are by the fire become the objects of charity, who were not ſo before, but rather the ſubjects, and diſpenſers of it: many that had wont to give, are now forced to receive: many that kept good hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, have now no houſes to keep; nor wherewith to build them any. To build for their ſakes were moſt charity; but if you, will not do ſo, build for your ſelves (I mean for your own profit, in conjunction with a publick good) and let them to whom you pleaſe. Build with regard to a noble City (now deſolate) if you will not do with reſpect to indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, and impoveriſhed Citizens.</p>
            <p>Had <hi>London</hi> been the tail of all the Cities of <hi>England,</hi> it had been pitty to have always loſt it; but much more pitty it would be in regard it was the head We read how <hi>the people lift up their voices and wept, that there ſhould be one tribe lacking in Iſrael;</hi> and yet that tribe was but little <hi>Benjamin,</hi> Judg. 21.3. Had it been <hi>Judah</hi> (and was not <hi>London</hi> as it were our <hi>Judah</hi>) would not their lamentation have been yet greater? As they ſtudied to repair that loſt tribe, ſo ſhould all Engliſh-men endeavour to repair this: It will chiefly concern rich men to do it, but ſurely the poor are not quite exempted. As in repairing the high wayes, our laws have provided, that they who do not or cannot hire others, ſhould work at it themſelves, ſo many dayes: So methinks it ſhould be in repairing of this great breach. It is a common good, and therefore ſhould be done at a common charge, though moſtly at theirs who have
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:45718:57"/>moſt intereſt in &amp; benefit by it. They that had not gold, and ſilver to bring for the building of the Tabernacle, were to bring <hi>Goats hair, or Badgers skins,</hi> or the like, <hi>Exod.</hi> 25.5.

            </argument>
            <p>HE that is a friend to <hi>London,</hi> is (as ſuch) a friend not only to one City, or to one King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, but to three united under one and the ſame Sovereign, <hi>viz.</hi> to <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland:</hi> Theſe three like the ſeveral Kingdoms and Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palities
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:45718:58"/>in <hi>Germany</hi> conſtitute but one Emperour: They are but three great Arms of one and the ſame Sea or Ocean, the great Port or Haven whereof is <hi>London:</hi> They are but three great branches of that mighty Tree, whereof <hi>London</hi> is the root. So Moraliſts divide the Soul into ſeveral faculties, as the Underſtanding, Will and Affections, whereas the Soul is indeed but one, all is but one Soul no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally ſo diverſified, and diſtinguiſhed. So ſome Divines tell us, that whereas we ſpeak of ſeveral Graces, calling one Faith, another Love, a third Repentance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> it is no otherwiſe to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, than when we ſpeak of the Brittiſh, the Iriſh, the German Ocean, and ſeveral others; all which indeed are but one and the ſame, aſſuming different names and appellations, from the different ſhores which they waſh upon: It is not diſtance of place, nor yet interpoſition of Seas, (one or more) that can make thoſe places unconcern'd one in another, which do all belong to one and the ſame Prince and Governour, any more than our feet are, or can be unconcerned in our heads, becauſe they ſtand at as great a diſtance therefrom, as can be in one and the ſame body.</p>
            <p>Doubtleſs <hi>London</hi> is the glory, the ſtrength and ſtability, the Magazine and Storehouſe, of all the three Nations, at leaſtwiſe ſo it hath been, and ſo it is neceſſary it ſhould alwayes be, and ſo I hope it will.</p>
            <p>Firſt, I ſay it is and hath been the beauty and glory of theſe three Kingdomes: Theſe three Regions are but one Firmament, and the Sun of that Firmament hath ſtill been <hi>London;</hi> all three have ſhoan with the beams of <hi>London;</hi> as they ſay in Law a Wife doth <hi>(radiis mariti)</hi> with the beams of her Husband. Doubtleſs <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi>
               <pb n="79" facs="tcp:45718:58"/>were proud of a <hi>London</hi> they had intereſt in; (and which in a ſenſe was theirs as well as <hi>Englands,</hi> though not ſo much) if <hi>London</hi> were our Mother, it was their Grandmother, and that was an honour to them.</p>
            <p>I have further ſaid, that <hi>London</hi> was the ſtrength and ſtability of the three Kingdomes, and ſo it was; as when there are three great Families allied to one another, (ſuppoſe as Brethren or Siſters) they are a mutual ſtrength and eſtabliſhment one to another; but the Head, or Chieftain of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Family, is a greater ornament and ſupport to all the three, than any one of the reſt, is or can be. So in this caſe; for <hi>London</hi> was (as I may call it) the Head of theſe three great Families, (King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes I mean.) As the ſtrength of <hi>Sampſon</hi> lay in his hair, and when that was cut, he became weak as another man, ſo did the ſtrength and puiſſance of theſe three Nations lie in <hi>London;</hi> there the force of <hi>England</hi> was moſt united; there, as in a center, all the lines of ſtrength did meet, and a ſure rule it is, that <hi>vis unita fortior, the more united any force is, the ſtronger it is. London</hi> was as the Sea, the tide whereof runs much more ſtrongly than that of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular rivers, becauſe all rivers run into the Sea, and from thence hath its name, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.10. <hi>The ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering together of the waters he called Seas.</hi> The beams of ſtrength were concentred in <hi>London,</hi> the great populouſneſs and plenty, its great fulneſs both of people, wealth and wiſdome conſidered, as the beams of the Sun might be in a burning-glaſs.</p>
            <p>It will need little proof, that <hi>London</hi> is alſo the great Magazine, and ſtore-houſe of the three U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited (if now I may call them united) Kingdoms, <hi>London</hi> as <hi>Tyre</hi> may be called <hi>a Mart of Nations,</hi> it being the great Emporium or Mart-Town, to
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:45718:59"/>which, not <hi>England</hi> only, but alſo <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> are beholden for multitudes of commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: Not only Country Towns, and inferiour Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in <hi>England,</hi> do repleniſh themſelves with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny or moſt things, which they need from the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>London,</hi> but alſo <hi>Edenburgh</hi> and <hi>Dublin,</hi> the two <hi>Metropoles,</hi> one of <hi>Scotland,</hi> the other of <hi>Ireland,</hi> (if I may call them any more than <hi>London</hi>'s De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties, or vice Metropolitans) are glad to do the ſame. Thus we ſee theſe three Nations are in point of honour, ſtrength and Supplies, united under one great City, <hi>viz. London,</hi> as well as under one and the ſame King (the genius of our Government affecting a kind of Monarchy as well in and amongſt Cities, as in other things.) And thus what was ſaid of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> holds true of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, ſhe was great amongſt the Nations, and Princeſſe amongſt the Provinces,</hi> Lam. 11.11.</p>
            <p>Now if I can prove but one thing more, <hi>viz.</hi> that no City within the compaſſe of theſe three Kingdoms, is fit to ſucceed <hi>London</hi> in its primacy, or able to head three Nations ſo honourably and profitably, as it hath done, I ſhall then have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated that <hi>England, Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> are all three highly concerned in the Reſtauration of <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That three ſuch Nations (the form of whoſe Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment is Monarchical) have ſome one head (head City I mean) over and above all the reſt, is but ſuitable and neceſſary, neither can it be leſs evident, that it is of great importance, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever place or City be their Head, ſhould be the beſt and fitteſt of all others for that purpoſe. Now that <hi>London</hi> is ſo, I appeal to the incomparable commodiouſneſs of its ſcituation, (well known to all men) and the advantage which in that reſpect it
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:45718:59"/>hath above any other place in the three Nations. By this was it ſo manifeſtly deſigned (as it were from heaven) for Primacy and Metropolitanſhip, that I know no Town or City that was ever Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitor with it in that behalf, or did ever pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to be what it is, <hi>viz.</hi> chief, whilſt <hi>London</hi> its ſelf was in being: Now what but the indiſputably ſupereminent fitneſſe of <hi>London</hi> to be the Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polis of <hi>England</hi> (and the United Kingdoms) could have prevented all Uſurpations, Pretenſions, and Competitions, even from thoſe places, which had themſelves worn the Crown of Dignity whilſt, and ſo long as <hi>London</hi> was (as ſeveral times it hath been, and now partly is) in the duſt.</p>
            <p>And now have I undeniably proved (if I mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake not) that theſe three Nations are highly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in the Reſtauration of <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But now the queſtion will be, whether all the Proteſtant part of the world be ſo likewiſe (as hath been affirmed) tell me then whether <hi>England</hi> (when it is its ſelf) be not able to yield a counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and protection to Proteſtants all the world over, to be a kind of covering upon all their glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry? If I am not deceived it hath done ſo, (particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly in the daies of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>) and may do ſo again. As is the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, <hi>viz.</hi> their great prop and pillar, ſo <hi>England</hi> hath been, is, or may be, to the Proteſtants.</p>
            <p>If then the ſtrength and bulwark of Proteſtants be <hi>England,</hi> and that the ſtrength of <hi>England</hi> (as hath been proved) be <hi>London,</hi> we may eaſily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude by that ſure Maxim, <hi>Cauſa cauſae eſt cauſa cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſati;</hi> that <hi>London</hi> is (or may be) the great bulwark and fortreſſe of the Proteſtant Intereſt; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, that the whole Proteſtant World is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in the being and well-being of <hi>London.</hi> This
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:45718:60"/>the great Zealots for Popery have known, and do know too well, who in order to the Propagation of that Religion, have thought, and do think no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more requiſite, than that the City of <hi>London</hi> ſhould be laid in aſhes, and continued there. <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> being ſo mighty in ſhipping as it is (at leaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe hath been, or may be) may be ſerviceable to them that profeſſe the ſame Religion with its ſelf, not only near at hand, but at the greateſt diſtance; and will be ſo, if ever God ſhall cauſe the zeal, and the proſperity of it, both to revive together. Let me add, that if <hi>London</hi> flouriſh, <hi>England</hi> cannot like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly do much amiſſe, and the moſt zealous part of the world (as for the Proteſtant Religion) will then proſper, to the advantage of all others who make the ſame profeſſion.</p>
            <p>What is it then, that not only <hi>England,</hi> but <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and not thoſe Kingdoms only, but any part of Chriſtendome (called Proteſtant) can do, or contribute towards the rebuilding of <hi>London?</hi> whatſoever it be, their own intereſt doth call upon them to do it with all their might: If <hi>London</hi> riſe not, they are like to fall after it. Shall we not hear of the kindneſſes of <hi>Holland, Sweden, Denmark,</hi> much more of all <hi>England,</hi> and of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> (if they be able to do any thing) towards poor deſolate <hi>London?</hi> let them be good to themſelves in being good to it, its intereſt is their own: Help <hi>London</hi> now, you know not how ſoon you may need its help, and find it both a chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and conſiderable helper, in a time of need.</p>

But where is that Piety and Charity to be found? Methinks I hear the Papiſts vaunting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves againſt Proteſtants, extolling their Superſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion above our true Religion, and their Doctrine of Lies above the truth of ours, telling us, that they built moſt of thoſe Churches and Hoſpitals which are now burnt down, and muſt do it again, if ever it be done; as <hi>Peninnah</hi> (when time was) did upbraid <hi>Hannah, Sam.</hi> 1.1. with her barren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, ſo do they the principles of the Proteſtant Religion, as if they could bring forth no good works.</p>
            <p>As for their building thoſe houſes again, there may be more reaſon for that than I ſhall preſume to give, but that (if it muſt be our work) our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion will not as ſtrongly invite us to do it as theirs would, (if they might build them for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves) that I utterly deny.</p>
            <p>True it is, if God ſtood in need that men ſhould lie for him, none were fitter to do him ſervice than they, whoſe Religion is full of lies and Legends, but that he doth not; but of ſuch as ſay (or report the Apoſtles of Chriſt to ſay) <hi>Let us do evil that good may come of it,</hi> the Scripture ſaith, <hi>their damnation is juſt,</hi> Rom. 3.8.</p>

            <p>We know there is truth enough in the world, or rather in the Word of God, to make men as cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable and free (in that ſenſe) as it is fit they ſhould be. We diſtruſt not the efficacy of Divine Truths, as they do, nor think them Nouns Adje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive that cannot ſtand without our lies, as if they were ſo many Subſtantives added to them: We therefore tell men (as the truth is) that <hi>by the works of the Law no fleſh ſhall be juſtified, Gal.</hi> 2.16. but withall we tell them, that good works (are <hi>cauſa ſine quâ non</hi>) or things without which there is no ſalvation, <hi>for faith without works is dead, as a body without a ſoul,</hi> and that there can be no love to God, where there is no charity towards men, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.17. <hi>Who ſo hath this worlds good, and ſeeth his Brother have need, and ſhutteth up his bowels from him, how dwelleth the love of God in him? He that loveth not his brother whom he hath ſeen, how ſhould he love God whom he hath not ſeen?</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.20. Therefore ſuch as have wherewithall to ſhew mercy, and to do good, cannot be ſaved, ſay we; and this principle well
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:45718:61"/>conſidered, were enough to make men charitable if we could add no more.</p>
            <p>But then we ſay further, that no one good work or deed of charity (that is truly ſuch) ſhall go with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a reward, quoting and urging <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.42. (with other Texts of like import) <hi>Whoſoever ſhall give a cup of cold water only to one in the name of a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, verily he ſhall not looſe his reward.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nay more than ſo, we tell men that the reward of charity, and of good works, (truly ſo called) is no leſſe than Eternal Life, (though not of merit, but of grace.) We <hi>charge them that are rich in this world,</hi> (as <hi>Paul</hi> bid <hi>Timothy</hi> to do) <hi>that they do good, that they be rich in good works, ready to diſtribute, willing to communicate, laying up in ſtore for themſelves a good foundation againſt the time to come, that they may lay hold on eternal life,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.18, 19. We mind men of our Saviours words, <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.33. <hi>Give almes, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide your ſelves bags that wax not old, a treaſure in the heavens that faileth not, where no thief approacheth, nor moth corrupteth.</hi> We ſay unto men as Chriſt ſaid, <hi>Luke</hi> 16.9. <hi>Make to your ſelves friends of the Mammon of unrighteouſneſs, that when ye fail, they may receive you into everlaſting habitations.</hi> We promiſe Heaven (in Gods Name) to thoſe that are truly charitable, and is it not worth accepting, unleſſe God will own it, or we our ſelves can think it, to be of debt, and not of grace?</p>
            <p>We deny that the infinite Juſtice of God, will or can receive ſatisfaction, or reparation, for the evil deeds which men have done, by the good deeds they may or ſhall do afterwards, (as by their works of charity, for former acts of injuſtice) for that ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction can be made only by the undertaking of our Saviour, who bore our ſins in his body upon the Croſſe, and <hi>who is held forth to be a propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:45718:62"/>for us through faith in his bloud, Rom.</hi> 3. But withall we ſay, that <hi>Zacheus</hi> having been an oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Publican, did well (and ſet others a good ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample) when he gave half his goods to the poor, <hi>Luke</hi> 19. (which furely he did upon that conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration) and that it was good counſel which <hi>Daniel</hi> gave to <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> Dan. 4.27. <hi>Break off thy ſins by righteouſneſs, and thine iniquities by ſhewing mercy to the poor;</hi> the meaning whereof may be, that he ſhould ceaſe from unrighteouſneſſe and cruelty, for time to come, and practiſe the contrary with all his might, <hi>viz.</hi> Juſtice and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; yea, we ſtick not to quote that paſſage of <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> Prov. 16.6. <hi>By mercy and truth iniquity is pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged;</hi> which may be conſtrued thus, where mercy is, iniquity is purged, that is, it is a ſign of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſins (as was <hi>Mary</hi>'s love to Chriſt) or that God of his free mercy (not of their merit) pardoneth thoſe who abound with mercy; as he hath ſaid, that <hi>with the merciful he will ſhew himſelf merciful;</hi> and with the garment of his undeſerved grace, God covereth a multitude of their infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties who are ſuch, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.8. We ſay, that more of bounty and charity towards men, than would other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe have been required of us, is neceſſary, and a duty, in caſe we have been injurious or unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to others formerly; for if ſo, we are in ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rears both of Juſtice and Mercy, which, as to men, (if we be able to pay) can no otherwiſe be ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, nor can remiſſion be obtained without ſuch a reſtitution.</p>
            <p>As for the fire of Purgatory, wherewith Popiſh Prieſts do melt down the gold and ſilver of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant people into their own Coffers, we know it is but a device to keep their own Kitchins warm; nor can any man give a reaſon why the charity of
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:45718:62"/>men ſhould be leſs inflamed by this real fire of Hell, made to flaſh in the faces of all that do, and ſhall remain unmerciful and uncharitable, than by the feigned fire of Purgatory: Why ſhould not, yea, will not men part with as much to keep themſelves out of Hell (when made ſenſible how damning a ſin covetouſneſs is) as to get themſelves out of Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory, ſooner than otherwiſe they would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect?</p>
            <p>To him that conſiders theſe things, it will be plain and evident, that thoſe Principles which all good Proteſtants do own, and inſiſt upon, have as great an aptneſs and powerfulneſs in their own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to awaken and excite man to works of charity, as any that Papiſts do, or can inſiſt upon: Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ought it to be forgotten, that all the fore-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned Principles of Proteſtants are real and Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, and being ſuch, muſt needs be of greater force, and authority, than thoſe groſſe Falſhoods, vain Dreams, and Bugbears, wherewith Popiſh Impoſtors delude their people.</p>
            <p>But here it may be a Papiſt would reply to us: How comes it to paſs if the Principles wherewith you Proteſtants indeavour to excite men to works of Charity, be in themſelves as forcible as thoſe we go upon, that we, in that caſe do prevail more than you? That by our inſtigations people are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to give all their goods to the poor, and to ſay to their very Parents, <hi>It is Corban, or a Gift (to the Church) by whatſoever thou mayeſt be profited,</hi> whereas you Proteſtants have much ado many times to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tort even from dying people (though rich) ſome few pounds or ſhillings to any good uſes?</p>
            <p>I wiſh I could ſay that the matter of fact herein objected were true <hi>pudet haec, &amp;c.</hi> but too true it is, and the reaſons of it (or ſome-of them) are as follow:</p>
            <pb n="88" facs="tcp:45718:63"/>
            <p>Firſt, Some Proteſtant Miniſters whilſt they are zealous in Preaching the Doctrine of Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication by Faith (ſo much oppoſed by Papiſts) are, and have been too remiſs in preſſing good works, according to the tenor of their own Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples: And thus whilſt the Papiſts bend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves againſt our Faith, they make us neglect good works: Such Miniſters ſhould be put in mind of what St. <hi>Paul</hi> writeth to <hi>Titus,</hi> chap. 3.8. <hi>Theſe things I will that you affirm conſtantly, that they which have believed in God might be careful to maintain good works: theſe things are good and profitable to men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, Proteſtant Preachers (if I miſtake not) do generally harp leſs upon the duty of boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and charity, in particular (towards the Church eſpecially) than Popiſh Prieſts do, who do ſome of them it may be, preach little elſe, at leaſtwiſe, that is the moſt they preſſe, becauſe the moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable of all ſubjects (though not to their hearers) (upon whom other duties are ſometimes as neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to be preſſed) yet to themſelves. Now Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Miniſters being too much afraid of being ſo much as ſuſpected of ſeeking themſelves, do, I fear, under-do, as to preſſing works of charity, whilſt Popiſh Prieſts are guilty of over-doing, being like <hi>the Horſeleech or Grave, which are never ſatisfied, but ſtill do cry, Give, give.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, Papiſts will venture to Promiſe more upon the bare <hi>opus operatum</hi> or meere act of giving, to ſuch and ſuch good uſes (to be bound as it were body, for body, and ſoul, for ſoul, that they that give ſo much to good uſes ſhall be ſaved) I mean (to warrant and enſure their Salvation) than Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Miniſters dare to do, who knew that <hi>the end of the Commandement</hi> (the fulfilling of which end is required in a ſaving charity) <hi>is charity out of
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:45718:63"/>a pure heart, and a good conſcience, and faith unfeigned;</hi> and that a <hi>man may give all his goods to the poor, and yet want that true charity without which</hi> (the Apoſtle ſaith) <hi>be is but as ſounding Braſſe, or tinkling Cym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ball.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Moreover the Popes of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſucceſſively, uſe to diſpenſe pardons for the greateſt ſins, and ſuch as were never repented of, for ſo much money, as a late Book called the <hi>Proteſtant Almanack</hi> (one that will never be out of date) makes out by mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes of Inſtances. This practice of theirs is one of <hi>the names of Blaſphemy written in their fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads,</hi> and by ſuch means as theſe they go beyond us.</p>
            <p>But the mony which is given upon the two laſt accounts, is certainly the reſult and product not of real bounty, but of woful blindneſs and ignorance. That which is ſuch a kind of cheat in the receivers, can hardly be called charity in the givers.</p>
            <p>Then may we draw to this concluſion, Papiſts have waies to cheat men of their mony which Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants have not (yet ſcorn to uſe) but Papiſts have no Arguments, truely deduced, either from Scripture, or ſound reaſon, wherewith to invite men to works of charity, that Proteſtants have not, and they alone well uſed and mannaged are and will be ſufficient.</p>
            <p>If Papiſts will take upon them to be wiſer than God, and to teach him (who is only wiſe) how to furniſh the World with better motives to chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and good works, than ever yet he hath done, ſo will not Proteſtants: It were better <hi>London</hi> ſhould continue in aſhes, than have its foundation laid in ſuch Blaſphemous Impoſtures: but that it need not do neither, for want of Scriptural Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, mighty (through God) to pull down the
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:45718:64"/>ſtrong holds of mens unmercifulneſs, and to bring into captivity every thought which exalteth it ſelf againſt obedience thereunto.</p>
            <p>We that are Proteſtants can tell men, according to our Principles, that the leaſt work of true cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity ſhall have a great reward, that the reward of perſons truely charitable, ſhall be no leſs than e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal life, that every ſuch work ſhall follow good men when they dye, and add to the weight of their Crown of Glory: We can tell rich men, that if they will not make to themſelves friends of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous <hi>Mammon,</hi> they ſhall not be received in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to everlaſting habitations (of glory) that if they ſhut up their bowels againſt poor <hi>Lazaruſes,</hi> they ſhall fare no better than <hi>Dives</hi> did, who denied his crumbs of bread, and was himſelf denied a drop of water: We can freely tell every man that it is as poſſible for him to get to Heaven without faith, as without charity; and as impoſſible for him to be ſaved without charity, as without faith. Then I appeal to every mans reaſon, whether it be not an act of charity, and piety, to help up with this poor City, and particularly with the Hoſpitals and Churches thereto belonging. Though our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion be by Papiſts reproached, as <hi>Hannah</hi> was by <hi>Peninnah</hi> with barrenneſs, namely in reference to good works, it may hereafter come (and I hope it will) to ſing as <hi>Hannah</hi> did, in 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.5. <hi>The barren hath born ſeven, and ſhe that hath many Children is waxed feeble.</hi>

            <argument>
               <p>
                  <hi>Upon the looks, and proſpect of</hi> London, <hi>whilſt but ſome few houſes are built, here and there, and others but building in the midſt of many ruinous heaps.</hi>
               </p>
            </argument>
            <p>
               <hi>O London</hi> what is thy preſent hue? how many other things art thou like unto at this day? but how unlike thy ſelf? unlike what thou wert, yea unlike what thou art, if we compare one part with another <hi>Mulier formoſa ſupernè deſinit in piſcem</hi> what a motley, linſey, woolſey, exchequered thing art thou at this day?</p>
            <p>One while methinks thou lookeſt like a forreſt in which are ſome tall trees, ſome ſhrubs; ſome meer ſtumps otherwhere, all pluckt up by the roots: or may I not liken thee to an old orchard, in which are ſome trees that have ripe fruit upon them, other have but buds, others but meer bloſſoms, but the greater part are dead, and withered? nor doſt thou leſs reſemble a great common field in which ſome early corn, is at full growth, elſewhere that which was latter ſown, hath yet but peept out of the ground, and very many acres up and down lie quite fallow. We read of the <hi>waters</hi> of <hi>the ſanctuary,</hi> how that <hi>ſome of them</hi> were <hi>but to the ancles, others to the knees, others up to the loins, Ezek.</hi> 47.4. That it may be was ſucceſſively, but this all at once. Thus in a family where are many children, ordinarily, there are ſome at the eſtate of men and women, ſome boyes and girles, ſome infants, and ſome (one or more) that are yet but in the mothers womb.</p>
            <p>Is <hi>London</hi> a village that I ſee the houſes in it ſtand
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:45718:65"/>ſo ſcatteringly, and at ſo great a diſtance one from another? ſcarce enough together to make that num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber which is ſaid to make a conventicle. 1. Having been degraded for a while, muſt it commence a village before it commence a City? As in a through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare village, ſtanding upon a great road, moſt hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes are Inns, or Alehouſes to entertain ſtrangers, ſo may we obſerve that the major part of houſes built upon the ruines; are let out to Alehouſe-keepers and Victuallers to entertain workmen imployed about the City.</p>
            <p>How eaſily doth the preſent condition of <hi>London</hi> bring <hi>France</hi> to mind, where a middle ſort of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are ſcarce to be found, but all are ſaid to be either Princes, (as it were) or Peaſants, Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, or ſlaves. Our ſtately-houſes may ſerve for an emblem of the former, our ruinous heaps of the latter; or one may repreſent the flouriſhing papiſts in that Country, and the other the oppreſſed <hi>Hugo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites,</hi> they and their Churches, lying together in aſhes.</p>
            <p>Would I give ſcope to phantaſy I could adde that <hi>London</hi> now looks like <hi>Euclids</hi> Elements, or ſome ſuch books, in which are all ſorts of ſchemes and figures, as ſtraight lines, crooked lines, trian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles, quadrangles, hexangles, and what not? or like a book of Anatomy, full of cuts repreſenting in one page the ſhape of a head, in another of an arm, in a third of a legg, &amp;c. So in one place there is as it were the head, or beginning of a ſtreet, in another place the feet (or end thereof) by its ſelf, elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where the arm, or breaſt, or belly of a ſtreet, (the middle I mean) ſtanding all alone.</p>
            <p>A goodly uniformity there is in ſo much of it as is built together, but ruines and confuſion round about it, which repreſents it like a beautiful face
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:45718:65"/>ſtuck with black patches, which is very lovely, ſo far as it is ſeen, but all the reſt is uglineſs, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity, manifeſt pride, and concealed beauty.</p>
            <p>Neither is <hi>London</hi> at this day unlike the month of <hi>April</hi> (in which I am writing this) conſiſting of quick viciſſitudes of rain, and ſunſhine, one part of the Heavens ſmiling, another frowning and lowr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. So one part of the ſtreet ſmiles upon us (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt throughout the ruines) but the reſt of it frown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and looks ghaſtly. If we compare it to one that is riſing out of his ſepulchre; it muſt be to one that hath his grave cloaths about him, for ſo hath <hi>London.</hi>)</p>
            <p>But when all is ſaid <hi>London</hi> at this day repreſents nothing more then our own diviſions, together with the ill effects and conſequences thereof.</p>
            <p>For firſt of all, is it not unquoth, and doleſome, to live in houſes that ſtand at ſuch a diſtance one fom another? (Some of them <hi>like a cottage in a gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of cucumbers</hi>) How much more pleaſant was it, and would it be again, to be ſurrounded with neighbours on every ſide: To ſuch an unquoth, ſolitary and unpleaſant condition have our diviſions brought us. Methinks the depth and dead of win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, when the nights are tediouſly long, the weather raw and cold, the wayes wet and dirty; and almoſt impaſſable, when the trees are bald and bare, both of fruit and leaves, and when the earth hath put off all its ornaments, and is as it were in its night dreſs, or morning weeds, doth not more fall ſhort of that pleaſurableneſs and delightfulneſs that is in a delicate ſpring, or gallant ſummer, when the earth is full of all that may gratifie both our ſight, ſent and palate: when deckt like a bride, when crowned with the goodneſs of God, than a time of diviſions, and diſſentions, doth in point of comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:45718:66"/>fall ſhort of theſe times in which Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians and fellow Cittizens have been all (or gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally) of one heart, if not of our mind, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 133.1. <hi>Behold how pleaſant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity?</hi> The diviſions of <hi>England</hi> now (as they of <hi>Reuben</hi> in former time) do they not cauſe ſad thoughts of heart?</p>
            <p>That houſes in <hi>London</hi> ſtand ſo ſcatteringly, as now they do, is (if I be not miſtaken) not more unpleaſant, than unſafe. By this their ſingle ſtation they are more obnoxious to the impreſſions of wind and weather, which now have opportunity to play on every ſide of them, which when guarded (as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly) by houſes, on one, or both ſides, and poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly behind alſo, could not be done: not to conceal the other part of their danger: many of thoſe lone houſes ſeem to lye at the mercy of theeves, and robbers, whoſe mercies are known to be cruelties) and I doubt not but many in that regard are afraid to dwell in the houſes, which themſelves have built, till others ſhall come to dwell by them.</p>
            <p>So inſecure do our diviſions render us, and the diſtance at which we keep, one from another, whilſt it is ſo with us, we may much more eaſily be <hi>car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried about with every mind of doctrine, and by the ſlight of men, and cunning craftineſs, whereby they lye in walt to deceive.</hi> Scattered ſhips are much more eaſily ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by Pirats, or enemies, than is a whole fleet that rides together; and a ſmall family (or a piece of one) is ſooner rob'd, than a family that is intire, great and numerous; <hi>Divide &amp; impera,</hi> divide them and rule them, was an old maxime, divided we are, and now our enemies hope to rule over us. Our religion is our great treaſure, and doubtleſs there are theeves that hope to break in, and ſteal it from us, now they ſee us dwell alone (as it were)
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:45718:66"/>I mean in reference to our diſſentions.</p>
            <p>Neither is it more unquoth and unſafe, than it is unprofitable, for Citizens to dwell by themſelves, or only two or three, or ſome few more families, in one and the ſame ſtreet: Few expect to have any conſiderable Trade within the Walls (ſo far as the Ruines did extend) till the City be built again, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther all, or moſt of it; and therefore though they have built houſes for themſelves, in thoſe parts of <hi>London</hi> which were, and will be moſt conſiderable, as <hi>Cheapſide, &amp;c.</hi> yet do they refrain to go to them, till their Neighbourhood be encreaſed, and others, to a conſiderable number, have built near them, as expecting but few Cuſtomers, and ſmall dealings, till that be done.</p>
            <p>So fatal have our diviſions, and the diſtance at which we have ſtood one from another, I ſay ſo fatal have they been to us in point of Trade and profit, as the remoteneſſe and ſcattering of houſes, one from another, would probably be to thoſe that ſhould attempt a Trade in houſes ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more and ſcattered. Diviſions, and decay of Trade began together, and have proceeded together; as diviſions grew greater, trading hath grown leſſe; as more backwardneſſe hath appeared, as unto uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Proteſtants one with another, they ſay a ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble damp hath come upon Trade, not unlike thoſe damps which ariſe in Cole-pits, which put out their lights, and ſometimes ſtifle the workmen. And on the other hand, any hope given us, as if our breaches ſhould be healed, and our differences com-primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, hath been to Trade as a ſudden reſurrection from the dead, as if peace and union, concord and quietneſſe, one with another, were the Sun, Trade, and Traffique, the <hi>Heliotrope,</hi> or Mary-gold, which did open and ſhut, according as that Sun did either
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:45718:67"/>riſe or ſet, ſhine or forbear to ſhine upon it: That ſaying of <hi>Solomon</hi> is but too applicable to trade and commerce, as well as in other caſes: <hi>How can two walk together unleſs they be agreed?</hi> at leaſtwiſe ſo far agreed they muſt be, as not to moleſt, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb, each other.</p>
            <p>It is methinks an ill proſpect, and a gaſtly ſight, for thoſe that look from the Belconies, or tops of their ſtately new houſes, to ſee aſhes, and ruinous heaps on every ſide of them, to ſee ten private houſes (beſides Churches and publick Halls) in the duſt, for one that is raiſed again. This might be a pleaſing ſpectacle to a perſon <hi>of an evil eye,</hi> that is, to one that were full of envy (for ſuch people will be miſerable if others be happy) and count it a happineſs to themſelves to ſee others miſerable:) But he that hath <hi>put on Bowels as the elect of God,</hi> and knows how to <hi>mourn with them that mourn,</hi> will but half enjoy his own houſe (how goodly ſoever) whilſt ſo many of his neighbours lie waſte about it.</p>
            <p>Have not our Diviſions brought <hi>England</hi> into the ſame caſe with <hi>London,</hi> and made us like-City, like-Nation? Though here, and there, a Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hath wealth enough and to ſpare (whom I may compare to the fine houſes which are built here, and there one, upon the ruines of <hi>London</hi>) yea though ſome have fiſhed notably in troubled waters, and made all the rivers which ran in ſeveral channels to pay tribute to their Sea, I mean inriched themſelves by the help and advantage of other mens diviſions, and diſſatisfactions, yet it is far otherwiſe with the greater part of the Nation, the generallity of which are brought to a morſel of bread (I mean to great and deplorable poverty) Landlords not able to live without their rents, tenants not able to pay them,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:45718:67"/>tradeſmen not able to ſubſiſt by their callings, many left without callings to ſubſiſt by, and all theſe latter ſorts of men are pourtrayed to the life in and by thoſe houſes, (and thoſe the major part) which do yet lye in duſt and aſhes; they by reaſon of the late material fire, but the former by reaſon of a more immaterial fire, <hi>viz.</hi> of Strife and Conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion not extinguiſhed to this day.</p>
            <p>We have not yet done with comparing the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent caſe of <hi>London</hi> for want of more things to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare it to: We might farther liken it to the firſt World, when but a day or two, of Creation-work had paſſed upon it. It was then no perfect <hi>Chaos,</hi> neither was it a perfect World. Or I might liken it to the firſt appearance of a ſecond World, after the firſt was drowned. Is not <hi>London</hi> ſuch a thing as that was, where ſome high trees, and high mountains began to ſhew themſelves, here and there; but all the reſt continued under water? So gradually and leiſurely, doth our City riſe.</p>
            <p>But ſuch ſhall not be the reſurrection of the Juſt, for they ſhall not riſe one by one but <hi>(ſemel &amp; ſimul)</hi> all together, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.52. <hi>In a moment, in the twink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of an eye at the laſt trump, the dead ſhall be raiſed, and we ſhall be changed. We which are alive and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main to the coming of the Lord ſhall not prevent them which are aſleep, we which are alive ſhall be caught up together with them in the clouds.</hi> 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.15, 17.</p>
            <p>And now methinks I have done by <hi>London,</hi> as people uſe to do by young children, whoſe looks are yet come to no ſetledneſs, or conſiſtence. Some cry they are like the Fathers; others, that they are like the Mother; others again that they are like this or that kinſman, or kinſwoman. I have likened it to very many things, and ſurely it hath ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance of every of them. But when ſhall we ſee
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:45718:68"/>it like its ſelf again? or every where, like what it now is, ſo far as it is now its ſelf? Here, and there, ſomething is hatcht: but for the moſt part, <hi>London</hi> is but as an Egge, that we hope may be hatcht in time. It looks much worſe than it did before the fire, but yet much better than it did preſently after the fire: ſo that it gives us occaſion <hi>to ſing both of Judgment and mercy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Seeing ſo mixt a face of <hi>London,</hi> as now I do, ſome little part thereof ſo lovely as it is; the reſt ſo lamentable; I can do no leſs than purſue it with my moſt earneſt prayers, that as the corrupted bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of believers, ſhall one day be conformed to their incorruptible Souls, and not their immortal Souls ever made like to their mortal bodies, and as the Church militant ſhall hereafter be made glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, as that which is now Triumphant, but the Triumphant Church never conformed in ſufferings to that which is militant; ſo the ruinous part of <hi>London,</hi> may in Gods good time, become ſuch as that which is now moſt beautiful; but the beautiful beginnings thereof (in ſpight of all that wiſh it) may never become ruinous.</p>

            <argument>
               <p>
                  <hi>That uniting, or at leaſt wiſe quieting the minds of men, as to matter of Religion (ſo far as it can be done) would much conduce to the rebuilding of the City.</hi>
               </p>
            </argument>
            <p>I Am not of their mind, that think it an impoſſible thing, to give the generality of men (that are any wayes conſiderable) ſome reaſonable ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and contentment in point of Religion. It may be difficult, but ſurely it is feaſible. If it hath
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:45718:68"/>been, and is done elſewhere, why not amongſt us?</p>
            <p>That the World may ſee I do not drive at <hi>Anar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy</hi> in Religion, the firſt principle I would here ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt, is, That it cannot reaſonably be expected from Rulers and Governors, to give equal countenance and incouragement to all ſorts of Religion within their reſpective Dominions, <hi>viz.</hi> to the Chriſtian, Jewiſh, and Mahumetan Religion. We would not that the Supream Magiſtrate ſhould appear like a Sceptick, as if he were inclined to all Religions, but ingaged in none: Much leſs would we, that the Laws of a Nation ſhould have a Religion to chooſe, and ſhould reſpect all alike, that is, either afford no countenance, and maintenance, (or more than con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nivance) to any, or the ſame to all.</p>
            <p>If the Chriſtian Magiſtrate do think ſome Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons damnable, as the Jewiſh, Mahumetan, and the like, no reaſon he ſhould provide a maintenance for them, or for the Teachers of them, as of that Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, in, and by which he believeth men may be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
            <p>Private men are not willing, to communicate their ſubſtance to the Teachers and leaders of a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion Fundamentally different from their own. What Proteſtant would voluntarily contribute to the maintenance of Popiſh Prieſts, as ſuch? any more than to the making of a golden Calf? why then ſhould any ſuch thing be expected from Proteſtant Magiſtrates?</p>
            <p>It is more it may be than Rulers can do, without impoveriſhing a Nation, to provide a ſufficient maintenance for the Ring-leaders of all parties and perſwaſions, and therefore upon that accompt (though upon many others alſo) muſt let fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal diffenters ſhift for themſelves. Howſoever, to give the ſame encouragement to good and evil, truth
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:45718:69"/>and falſhood, (I mean to what is fundamentally ſuch, in the account of thoſe by whom Laws are made, and publick affairs adminiſtred) is, or ſeemeth to be as irrational a thing, as for a Father to intruſt a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digal child with as great an eſtate as the reſt of his children that are good husbands; or one that is a fool, or mad man, as thoſe that have wit to manage it, or as it is to reward vice at the rate of vertue.</p>
            <p>The Principle I have laid down beſpeaketh no <hi>Anarchy</hi> or confuſion in Religion, becauſe it aimeth at ſome one Religion to be prefer'd above all the reſt, <hi>viz.</hi> that which the Legiſlators of a Nation ſhall think fit to eſtabliſh, own, and countenance, as the publick, authorized Profeſſion of this or that Nation, which being ſo eſtabliſhed, is not alterable at the ſole and ſingle will and pleaſure of the Prince, (to be ſure in <hi>England</hi>) as having not power in, and of himſelf to repeal ſuch Laws as are made (whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Religion or perſwaſion himſelf be of;) which objections being removed out of the way, I ſee no reaſon why any body ſhould be offended (and I think upon the reaſons aforeſaid, very few will) if the Law of a Nation, and Magiſtrates, whoſe work it is to put thoſe Laws in execution, do afford that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance and maintenance to one ſort of Religion, and to the leaders thereof, which they afford not to any other that is fundamentally oppoſite thereunto; as is the Jewiſh or Mahumetan to the Chriſtian; and the Popiſh, in ſome things, to the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant.</p>
            <p>One or two objections more, which are all I can imagine, may be raiſed againſt this firſt principle, will be anſwered by and by; And therefore I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to a ſecond, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Religion of a Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on need not, ought not, yea indeed cannot, <hi>conſiſtere in puncto,</hi> but <hi>intrà aliquam latitudinem.</hi> It muſt
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:45718:69" rendition="simple:additions"/>needs be like a circle with ſeveral lines drawn within, all which, though they meet and touch in one and the ſame centre, yet are ſomewhat diſtant each from other, in the circumference: What I af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed laſt, I ſhall prove firſt, <hi>Viz.</hi> That Religion cannot be made to conſiſt in a point, that is, that all perſons who are truely of one, and the ſame Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, can never come to agree in every <hi>punctilio:</hi> For as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.2. <hi>One believeth that he may eat all things, another who is weak, eateth Herbs,</hi> and verſe 5. <hi>one man eſteemeth one day above another, another man eſteemeth every day alike; let e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man be fully perſwaded in his own mind.</hi> He that converſeth with men, about ſuch matters as can admit of any diſpute, will find it daily, and hour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly verified, that all men cannot <hi>idem ſentire,</hi> that is, have the ſame ſentiments, and apprehenſions, as to ſuch things, but <hi>ſo many men, ſo many minds,</hi> proves too true a Proverb.</p>
            <p>Thence I infer in the next place, that Religion ought not <hi>conſiſtere in puncto,</hi> that is, men ought not to make, or pretend as if it did, or to inſiſt upon it that it ſhould do ſo, or to uſe force and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to bring it to that paſſe, it being a fruitleſs attempt ſo to do: Peradventure men may <hi>idem mentiri</hi> that is, counterfeit, and make ſhow as if they were all of a mind, when it is their worldly intereſt ſo to do, but then muſt they uſe many di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctions, reſervations, equivocations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> wherewith to ſalve themſelves and their pretended unanimity: for <hi>idem ſentire</hi> in matters doubtful, all men never can, no more than every mans Palate can be pleaſed a like with all ſorts of Meat and Sauces. Now that which puts men upon ſhifts, evaſions, illuſions, equivocations, and ſuch <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naniah</hi> and <hi>Saphirah</hi>-like tricks, which rewardeth
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:45718:70"/>men for the ſame, and puniſheth others that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do the like, that I ſay ought not to be, and therefore Religion ſhould not be handled as if it did conſiſt in an indiviſible point, as if every thing were fundamental, that is but circumſtantial; or certain, that is but probable; or fit to be impos'd, or inforc'd, which is but fit to be recommended.</p>
            <p>When I plead for ſome latitude to be allowed in matter of Religion, I go upon this ſuppoſition, that it is not amiſs for a Chriſtian Church to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare its opinion in ſome points of Religion, that are not abſolutely certain, and to give its advice in ſome matters of practice that are not abſolutely neceſſary (at leaſt-wiſe to ſalvation) and that all Churches uſe to do ſo, and ſuch advice of a Church, and declaration of its opinion, is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly reckon'd as part of the Religion which it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth. Now taking the Religion of a Church, in that large and vulgar ſenſe, as well for what it opineth, or doth but give its opinion, and advice in, as for what it determineth, and is peremptory in; I ſay, in reference to the former of theſe (though not to the latter) ſome latitude ought to be given, to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt diſſenters, either in Opinion or Practice: and that for the reaſons aforeſaid; St. <hi>Paul having receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed no Commandement from the Lord concerning Virgins,</hi> their marrying, or not marrying, only <hi>gave his judgement,</hi> that it was better at that time, not to marry, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.25. and then left them to their liberty, <hi>verſe</hi> 28. <hi>But if a Virgin marry, ſhe hath not ſinned;</hi> From which example of his, may be inferred, that where the mind of God is not clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly revealed, or there is no manifeſt Command, or Prohibition in the caſe, it is good to adviſe men the beſt we can, and then leave them to their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.</p>
            <pb n="103" facs="tcp:45718:70" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p>By what I have ſaid already may be underſtood, what I mean by the encouraging, and countenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of but one Religion in a Nation, ſo as by pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick owning and profeſſing of it, and by the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates providing a maintenance for the Profeſſors and Teachers of it, <hi>viz.</hi> that no more Religions ſhould expect to be maintained, and upheld by the Laws of one and the ſame Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, at a publick charge, than thoſe which are ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dically and fundamentally, one, and the ſame; but it is far from me to aſſert or think, that only one branch, of that Religion which hath the ſame root, ſhould be watered by the kindneſſe, and bounty of the Magiſtrate, whereas, ſurely every branch of the ſame tree, that beareth any fruit, ought to be ſo; as a Father ought to provide for all the Children that ſpring from his own loins, and do behave themſelves any thing towardly, and not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for ſo many of them as are of ſuch a complexion, and of ſuch a ſtature. What are perſons whoſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion agreeth in Fundamentals of Doctrine, and Practice, but Children of the ſame Father, and of the ſame Mother? and ſuch as ought not to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded by ſome few, that appropriate the Name of Sons to themſelves, as if they only were ſuch.</p>
            <p>I make account the true Proteſtant Religion is but one, in, and amongſt all the Profeſſors of it, though they that are ſuch, be ſome of them <hi>Calviniſts,</hi> others <hi>Lutherans,</hi> &amp;c. (as the Children of one and the ſame Father, have ſeveral Names) or as the ſeveral arms of the Sea though diverſly called, (are but one and the ſame Ocean.) That one Religion for the ſubſtance of it is common to all the true Profeſſors of it, as one and the ſame ſoul is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to all the parts of that body, which it belongs to, though of different ſhapes and figures, or as
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:45718:71"/>the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>There are diverſities of gifts, but one and the ſame Spirit, who worketh all and in all.</hi> When then I plead the reaſonableneſs of one Religion, and but one to have more than the connivance of Authority (<hi>viz.</hi> publick countenance and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance) I mean the whole body of that Religion (or rather of the Profeſſors and Teachers of it) if by diſhoneſt, unſober, and unpeaceable carriage (not by ſome variety in opinion, and modeſt pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice) they do not cut themſelves off. All this doth well ſuit with the notion which I have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for, <hi>viz.</hi> of a latitude within one and the ſame Religion, which I have proved cannot but be taken, and moreover that it ought to be given.</p>
            <p>And now I have one thing more to ſay, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning ſuch a latitude as I have pleaded for, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to contenting the minds of men in point of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion (which is the deſign of this chapter) I ſay, I have this to prove, that the vouchſafement of ſome latitude in Religion, both as to Opinion and Practice, needs not to be feared. They that dread it, are worſe ſcar'd than hurt: If ſome latitude in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged would deſtroy a Church, or Kingdom, few of either had been left in the World; for ſome ſuch thing is almoſt every where admitted, and allowed of, at leaſtwiſe connived at, and tollerated, even in the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church, which doth of all others moſt glory in its being at unity with it ſelf: Witneſs the Names of Diſtinction, and Oppoſition, which are found in that Church; Witneſs their writing, diſputing, and practicing, one contrary to another, the two former of which are more than I plead for.</p>
            <p>The danger lyeth not in Diſſents, but in <hi>Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> now the former may be without the latter: They that are of two minds may love one another
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:45718:71" rendition="simple:additions"/>far better (and oft times do) than they that are of one. Two humble, and well tempered men, of different Judgments, ſhall be dearer to one another, and have leſſer ſtrife than two proud men that are of the ſame. It doth not follow, that becauſe men are not of the ſame opinion they muſt wrangle, nor yet becauſe they are, that they will otherwiſe agree.</p>
            <p>Some that cannot comply with all and every the opinions, and practiſes of a Church in matters preter fundamental, may yet be better ſons to that Church in point of duty, honour and ſervice, than hundreds are, who either do, or ſeem, in all things to believe as the Church believeth. Mr. <hi>Chilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth</hi> (if I miſtake not) was a Son that the Church of <hi>England</hi> ſeemeth to be as proud of, as of moſt that ever ſhe bore, and yet we know he was no eccho to the Church, that could ſay all its words after it, he could ſubſcribe the Articles of the Church in no other ſenſe, than that they did contain in them what was ſufficient for the ſalvation of them that did believe and practiſe accordingly (which might conſiſt with their being interwoven with ſeveral miſtakes and errors, as a mans eating a hearty meal, though it preſuppoſe there is enough at the table, of that which he well liketh, may conſiſt with many other diſhes being there, that he doth not care for.) How many that could univerſally aſſent to the Church; have been a heavineſs to that their mother, and a ſhame to her, whileſt he that could go no farther than I have ſaid, who could not ſay <hi>credo eccleſiae,</hi> but <hi>in eccleſia</hi> was and is, a praiſe and a renown.</p>
            <p>We can have but mens words for it, that they are of our mind, or of the ſame opinion with the Church, and ſome mens words are but wind, and
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:45718:72"/>give us no aſſurance that what they ſay is true, or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it be, how great a change in the minds of weak and unſtable men, may a day or two produce, ſome of which are generally of that mans mind, whom they laſt diſcourſed with, and carried about with every wind.</p>
            <p>As for ſome latitude, and variety in practiſe, it was a thing the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſeemeth not to have been troubled at, nor willing that others ſhould be much concerned about it. <hi>One eſteemeth one day above another; another eſteemeth all daies alike; one believeth that he may eat all things; another being weak eateth herbs.</hi> The thing that perplexed him, was not that they did not do all alike, but that they did deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe, and judg one another for not doing the ſame thing. Different practiſe, in circumſtantial matters, cannot make ſo great a diſcrepancy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt one Church and another, and the ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces therein adminiſtred, as variety, and diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of gifts doth: and needs muſt make, whilſt the gift of one Miniſter lieth in explication, of another in application: one is a <hi>Boanerges,</hi> the other a <hi>Barnabas,</hi> one hath a lofty ſtile like <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> the other as plain as <hi>Amos,</hi> in one mans preaching an Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant may ſwim, but in another mans a Lamb may wade. Is the uſe of gifts given by God for the edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of the Church to be ſuppreſſed, becauſe gifts are ſo various and unlike one another? Is there not harmony even in that diſcord? what great deformity, or diſorder can there then be, in that ſmaller diſcrepancy, which ariſeth from the meer varying of circumſtances, ſuch as habits, po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures, geſtures, in which yet I would have no man to affect ſingularity, and to differ from others, no more than to ſuffer for that diſſonancy to others, which he cannot help, his conſcience being ſuch as
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:45718:72"/>it is. Did ever man complain that the motion of the Sun was irregular, and ill-favoured, becauſe a certain latitude is allowed him within his ecliptick line? which he makes uſe of, one while Northward, another while toward the South: nay is it not for the good of the world it ſhould be ſo?</p>
            <p>To return once more to a latitude as to opinions, about ſuch points of Religion as are not fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, I could plead for the allowance, or permiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of it by ſaying. Firſt, That much of that which is called controverſy is meer <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or ſtrife about words, we thinking others, and they us again, to be far more diſſonant than indeed we are, our meanings being like the tops of ſome mountains in <hi>Wales,</hi> which do or ſeem even to touch one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but our words like the bottomes of thoſe mountains, which are many miles aſunder. Men oft-times do neither contradict us, nor prejudice themſelves, ſo much by their different opinions, as we take them to do, becauſe they ſeem to differ from us, and from the truth more than they do.</p>
            <p>Secondly, By ſome liberty of diſputing, as by knocking of two flints together, ſome ſparks of light are brought out, and men are more confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in the truth, <hi>nihil eſt tam certum quàm quod ex dubio certum.</hi> Thus trees by being ſhaken may take deeper root.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, to be in heart a diſſenter from a Church in ſome leſſe certain Opinions, if men be ſuch on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in heart, can no ways redound to the prejudice of Church or State, nor be ſo much as a grief to ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, if they pleaſe not to enquire into it; for as our Proverb ſaith, <hi>What the eye ſeeth not, the heart rues not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, diſſenters as to preterfundamental O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions, whilſt they ſpeak not Polemical, but pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctical
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:45718:73"/>language, (which is eaſie for them to do) can ſcarce be known to diſſent, but when men expreſſe controverted matters in School terms, (known terms of war and defiance) they do as it were beat up an alarm to thoſe of the contrary perſwaſion, and ſend them a challenge, and bring the enemy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout their ears: Prudent men by obſerving that rule, though they diſſent, yet can forbear to offend, and conſequently need not to be rejected for their inoffenſive diſſents.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, Thoſe that differ as to certain axiomes and principles, may draw the ſame concluſions from both, at leaſtwiſe aim at the ſame mark, yea, and hit it: They that diſagree in their ſpeculative part, may yet agree in the practick. So it is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that <hi>Calviniſts</hi> and <hi>Arminians</hi> differ but little in the applicative part of their Sermons: ſo have we ſeen Bowlers, ſome play their byaſſes up, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers down, at the ſame Miſtreſs, and both it may be have come near it. The notional part of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick is much altered from what it was, yet men cure diſeaſes as they had wont to do; and that change which is made in the Theory of Phyſick, makes lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle in the practice.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, God would that there ſhould be ſome la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude allowed, both as to opinion and practiſe, within the Verge and compaſs of the true Religion (which is every where radically and fundamentally the ſame) as we may eaſily gather; firſt from hence, that God hath left many ſmaller things in Religion <hi>adiaphorous,</hi> that is indifferent, and undetermined, as if intended on purpoſe for to be the Sphere of Chriſtian Liberty, within the compaſs of which men might act, or not act, do the ſame things, or differ one from another, and both without ſin. Of this there are many inſtances in Scripture, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="109" facs="tcp:45718:73"/>
            <p>Again, God hath left ſeveral other things in the Scripture dark and doubtful, admitting of <hi>doubtful diſputations,</hi> as the phraſe is, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. as to which the Church it ſelf can give no other ſatisfaction than its probable conjectures will afford, to which a reverence is due, yet not ſo great, as to receive thoſe probable &amp; conjectural interpretations of the Church (which may poſſibly be weakned by proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities on the other hand) as if they were matters of Faith, or as evident as are the Articles of our Creed, all but that one ſo ambiguouſly worded, <hi>viz.</hi> about Chriſt his diſcent into hell; not that the thing intended by that Article, as Doctor <hi>Pierſon</hi> and others expound it, is doubtful, but the manner of expreſſing it, putting the word Hell for <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and <hi>Sheol,</hi> which may ſignifie the grave, and the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate of death. But that by the way.</p>
            <p>If the God of Truth and Unity could have brook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed no latitude in the Opinions and practiſes of thoſe men that hold the ſame foundation of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Religion, ſurely he would have left nothing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different, but have given order concerning every pin belonging to his Church under the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, as well as to his Tabernacle under the Old, neither would he have left ſo many things doubtful and diſputable, as are manifeſtly left in that condition.</p>
            <p>This ſeemeth to have been done as in order to giving men ſomething of liberty, (a thing ſo ſweet and pleaſant) as is a fine Garden behind a cloſs houſe; ſo likewiſe (and that principally) to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe the charity and humility of men, that the weak ſhould learn not to judge the ſtrong, and the ſtrong not to deſpiſe the weak, and both of them to love the Image of God in one another, whilſt they ſee in each but little of their own, that is of the image
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:45718:74"/>of ſome of their own perſwaſions and practiſes.</p>
            <p>And now I have ſpoken ſo much for latitude, that ſome it may be will think I am a <hi>Latitudinarian</hi> in the vulgar ſenſe of the word, but I think they are miſtaken.</p>
            <p>Alas that I am got over but two Principles, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to the compoſure of the minds of men about Religion, I ſay but two principles all this while, <hi>viz.</hi> firſt, that it is unreaſonable for the Profeſſors of two, or more Religions, fundamentally oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite each to other; to expect equal countenance and incouragement from the Laws of one and the ſame Nation, <hi>Ex. gr.</hi> for Papiſts to expect that where the Laws of the Land are in favour of the Proteſtant Religion, they ſhould be as much in favour of the <hi>Roman Catholique</hi> (as they non-ſenſically call it) and therefore that Religion which is fundamentally op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to what the Law of a Nation hath eſtabliſhed, ought not (at leaſt by violence) to ſtruggle for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heminence, nor yet for parity; as we ſee the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants in <hi>France</hi> do neither expect, nor attempt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſuch thing, as to equalize, much leſſe to overtop the Papiſts, who there have the Law on their ſides: And why ſhould Papiſts attempt any ſuch thing here againſt thoſe Proteſtants, who in <hi>England</hi> have the Law on their ſide every whit as much? this principle received, would lay one great ſtrugling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout matter of Religion; the other, and only prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple we have finiſhed beſides this, is, that within the compaſſe of the owned and avowed Religion, ſome certain latitude ought to be admitted, that all the ſober and peaceable Profeſſors and Teachers thereof might be included, and not a piece of a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion accepted and protected, inſtead of the whole, and the reſt (to the great diſſatisfaction both of God and men) unwarrantably excluded. I doubt I muſt
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:45718:74"/>ride Poſt through the other principles and maxims, (unleſſe I ought rather to call them propoſals) which I would lay down, becauſe I have ſtayed ſo long up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the two firſt.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, whereas every Religion muſt and ought to be built upon ſome foundation, which no man within the power and Juriſdiction of the Nation profeſſing it, ſhould be ſuffered to raſe, or to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermine, by preaching, publick diſputing, or wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting againſt the ſame, I lay it down as a farther principle, to quiet men in point of Religion, <hi>viz.</hi> That fundamentals in Religion, or whatſoever things are ſo called, ought to be ſo plain in Scripture, that he who runs may read them, and ſhould themſelves be all manifeſtly <hi>built upon the foundation of the Prophets and Apoſtles,</hi> viz, <hi>of their Doctrine.</hi> In this caſe we muſt to the Law and to the Teſtimony, or elſe there will be no light in us. The Analogy or Rule of Faith (and what are true fundamentals of Religion but ſuch?) is, or ought to be taken out of the plaineſt Texts of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſuch as give light to the ſimple; for ſuch only can be <hi>index ſui &amp; obſcuri,</hi> that is, ſhine in their own light, and give light to others.</p>
            <p>Two things (if I miſtake not) go to the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuting of a fundamental truth, <hi>viz.</hi> that it be clear (as I have ſaid already) that is, <hi>de facto,</hi> though it may not be ſo <hi>de modo</hi> (as the doctrine of the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity) moreover, that it be of great conſequence, and importance, if not of abſolute neceſſity to ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to be known and believed. If either of theſe qualifications be wanting, it is no fundamental truth, nor fit to be received as ſuch, if both be preſent, they will prevent a great deal of ſtrife, and debate, which the putting of ſmall and doubtful things upon the Church for fundamentals,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:45718:75"/>(like the fallacy of <hi>non cauſa pro cauſà</hi>) would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce.</p>
            <p>Now whereas there are ſome points of Religion which for the great conſequence of them, as alſo for their clearneſs, <hi>de facto,</hi> are, and have been adjudged fundamental, particularly, the doctrine of the Trinity in Unity, which <hi>de modo</hi> is very ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure, the meaning and manner of which is very hard to explain; I would humbly propoſe, that the beſt way to avoid contention about ſuch obſcure Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of our Faith, were to ſtate them wholly, and only in the very words of Scripture, and to leave them to the Faith of men, juſt as there we find them, <hi>ex. gr.</hi> as the Apoſtle expreſſeth it, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.7. <hi>There are three that bear Record in Heaven,</hi> viz. <hi>the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghoſt, and theſe three are one:</hi> Why ſhould they not be judged to conſent with us in the Doctrine of the Trinity, who ſubſcribe to that Text, and to all others of like import, without any explication given either on their ſide, or on ours? For why ſhould we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire from others a punctual aſſent to our explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thoſe things, the manner of which we our ſelves do profeſs very little, if at all, to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand?</p>
            <p>Too peremptorily to explain things that are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt, if not altogether inexplicable, and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour thereby to conclude the Judgements of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, what is it, but to conjure up enemies, and to bring quarrelſom wits about our ears?</p>
            <p>Leaſt of all, may private or particular men take upon them poſitively to explain thoſe great my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries, contrary to that ſenſe which the Church for ſeveral ages hath given of them, and that (it may be) not without fear and trembling, leaſt it ſhould miſcarry in the expoſition of ſo myſterious Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles.
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:45718:75"/>They that differ from the known ſenſe of the Church, as to ſuch Articles, when ever they treat thereof, let them keep entirely to the letter of the Scripture, as to their Trench and Fort, and not <hi>come over the Brook Kidron</hi> (as I may call it, alluding to <hi>Shimei</hi>) and ſo long they will be ſafe, and the Church of God will be quiet: There are things e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough of greater concernment to practice, upon which no doubt or controverſie doth depend, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patiate upon them and ſpare not.</p>
            <p>If the Church be apt to take offence, that private perſons ſhould diffent from her publick ſenſe, as to matter of opinion, or practice, though modeſtly delivered by her, but as probably true, or good, ſhall I make ſo bold in that caſe, as to offer for peace ſake, that the Church would not be too in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitive into ſuch matters, but leave it to God to be (as by prerogative he is) the only <hi>ſearcher of hearts,</hi> that is, let the Church not labour to ſcrue mens judgements out of them, who deſire to keep their judgements to themſelves; and mean time do live honeſtly, and peaceably. For by ſo increaſing knowledge, and ſetting it ſelf as it were to ſhrive, and confeſſe men, ſhe will but increaſe ſorrow; as <hi>Solomon</hi> advertiſeth Eaves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>droppers, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 7.21. <hi>Take no heed to all words that are ſpoken leaſt thou hear thy Servant curſe thee:</hi> Liſten not too much, wink at ſmall faults, pry not into the hearts of men, which are the Ark of God. Some have ſaid that <hi>Spain</hi> hath diſpeopled, and undone it ſelf, by its <hi>Inquiſition:</hi> What need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Papiſts in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> daies, to have put that inſnaring queſtion to peaceable Proteſtants? <hi>viz.</hi> what underſtand you by <hi>Hoc eſt corpus meum?</hi> This is my Body; was it not to ſeek an occaſion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, that they might burn them? they that
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:45718:76"/>ſhall firſt examine and then puniſh the ſecrets of mens hearts, will but make work for themſelves, and put the Church into a flame. They that peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably follow a Religion, that we our ſelves do think, may and will bring them to Heaven at the laſt, ought not frivolouſly, or eaſily, to be diſturbed by us, ſith the end of Religion is to ſave the ſouls of men, and that which will do ſo ſhould be incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged, and not infeſted.</p>
            <p>Another rule laid down by the Apoſtle for the peace of the Church, and of the eſtate of Religion, is that in <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.1. <hi>We then that are ſtrong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak, and not to pleaſe our ſelves.</hi> They that know the things which are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different, and lawful to be done or let alone, to be ſo indeed, can diſpenſe with them in themſelves and others, without ſin: but they that think them to be really unlawful, (and they are the weak men in the ſenſe of this Text, as the former are the ſtrong) cannot do them without ſin: Let then our Chriſtian charity take the chair, and let it own them for weak Brethren, who to its ſelf ſhall appear to be ſuch, and when that is done, you that are ſtrong conſider, though it might beſt pleaſe your ſelves to make weak ones ſtoop to your burthens, it will be only pleaſing to God, that you ſtoop to their infirmities, and <hi>bear</hi> them <hi>viz.</hi> by forbearing thoſe that cannot help them.</p>
            <p>What of this chapter is yet behind will prove (if I miſtake not) like the <hi>Galaxia</hi> or <hi>milkie way</hi> in the Heavens, which is a circle made up of many ſtars, but very ſmall ones: or rather like the ſparks that fall from a ſteel, or flint ſtruck together, which are very little things, and ſoon over, though there be many of them. To ſave the pains of numbering particulars, make account that every diſtinct para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:45718:76"/>is a diſtinct head, and it is ſufficient. I had almoſt called the following paragraphs, by the name of <hi>Via lactea ad pacem Eccleſiae &amp; Regni,</hi> but that to baptize, or name a child before it be born is not ſo uſual.</p>
            <p>Contend not for thoſe things that are not worth contending for, and of that kind are all they; our contending for which would prevent a greater good.</p>
            <p>There are certain truths of ſmaller concernment, which though evident enough, are yet leſs valuable than peace, not that we may deny, or renounce any known truth (though the leaſt of all) to accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date the peace of Church, or ſtate (for that were to lye, which is in no caſe allowable) but we may forbear to urge and inſiſt upon them. It was as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally true, as any thing elſe can be, that no ſort of meat was common, or <hi>unclean in it ſelf,</hi> Rom. 14.14. and that circumciſion was not neceſſary, nor yet the obſervation of ſuch daies as under <hi>Moſes</hi> his Law were appointed, but yet the Apoſtle would not break the peace of the Church about ſuch ſmall matters, but ſuffer every man to abound in his own fenſe, and bids them <hi>follow after the things which make for peace, and wherewith one may edifie another,</hi> Rom. 14.19.</p>
            <p>Offend not the conſciences of other men, but when if you did it not you muſt offend your own. <hi>Paul</hi> even before his converſion, did not perſecute men for their conſciences, but out of zeal, <hi>concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing zeal</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>perſecuting the Churches:</hi> and in <hi>Acts</hi> 26.9. he ſaith, <hi>I verily thought with my ſelf that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jeſus of Nazareth,</hi> nay in ſaying that, <hi>he obtained mercy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he did it ignorantly in unbeliefe:</hi> he intimateth, that if he had not done it out of a miſguided conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:45718:77"/>he had ſinned unpardonably. Wo be to them (if there be any ſuch) that burthen their own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, that they may burthen other mens, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as no man ought to burthen the conſcience of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man, but when thereby he may lighten his own, <hi>viz.</hi> By doing that, which he thinks to be his indiſpenſable duty. If I baptize my children, as being perſwaded that God requireth me ſo to do, and thoſe that are againſt Infant Baptiſm are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended at it; that is ſcandal taken, not given. For in matter of conſcience, charity muſt begin at home, I muſt take more care to gratifie my own conſcience, than any other mans. But to vex the conſciences of other men, in ſuch caſes as our own do not command us ſo to do, but rather counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand us, not command but rather check, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trole for ſo doing, is to make a great approach to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards that <hi>great tranſgreſſion, viz.</hi> the ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt, as ſome do underſtand it. I foreſee the Church will injoy a great deal of reſt, and peace, when no more ſhall be done to the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of men, then what ſhall be impoſed upon them that do it, not by their luſts and intereſts; but by their very conſciences.</p>
            <p>Religion ſhould be made uſe of for the edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all, for the deſtruction of none. Then is Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion (or what is ſo called) made a ſtalking horſe, in the worſt ſenſe that can be, when it is deſigned as a <hi>ſnare upon mizpeh,</hi> or as an inſtrument of mens ruine (though but temporal) how abominable was the ſaying of thoſe <hi>Perſian</hi> Princes, <hi>Dan.</hi> 6.5. <hi>We ſhall not find any occaſion againſt this Daniel except we find it againſt him, concerning the Law of his God.</hi> Their own conſciences would have been better ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, if they could have found occaſion againſt him concerning the kingdome, (for that they firſt
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:45718:77" rendition="simple:additions"/>ſought for) but they could find none, <hi>foraſmuch as he was faithful, neither was there any errour or fault found in him.</hi> How deviliſh was that policy that aimed at throwing ſuch a man as he into the Lions den, by commanding him to reſtrain prayer from the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty for ſo many daies together? which kind of policy ſtrikes with a two edged ſword, for if men yeild againſt conſcience, they are in danger of Hell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fire, if they yeild not, they are almoſt ſure of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing temporally undone. They that ſhall make a net of Religion, in any other ſence, than to catch Souls for Heaven, will make the Church a moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of prey, and the waters of the Sanctuary to be ſtiled <hi>meribah</hi> or waters of ſtrife. <hi>Dan.</hi> 6.24. and may themſelves in time be caſt into a Den; as they have caſt others: and thoſe Lions have maſtery over them, and break all their bones, which before were Lambs till they made Lyons of them.</p>
            <p>Make the yoke of Religion as light; and as eaſy, as you can, and let it not be only tollerable, or not more than men can make a ſhift to bear: for when the wayes of wiſdom are ways of pleaſantneſs, then aſſuredly will her paths be peace. He whoſe maſter puts him to as much work as ever he can do, and what is next to that would exceed his ſtrength, will never have his ears bored in the ſervice of ſuch a maſter, thereby reſigning himſelf to be his ſervant for ever. A man had better accept of leſs work, with more good will, and chearfulneſs. I pity that old man that ſaid he did ſo, and ſo, but with a trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling hand, and an aking heart; and that he thought every conſcientious man did the ſame thing in the ſame manner.</p>
            <p>To them that deſire the uniting of all worthy and ſober men, give me leave to ſay, that ſuch would ſwallow gnats, if they might be exempted from
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:45718:78"/>Camels; I ſay for the ſake of publick work, and publick peace, they would ſwallow ſuch things as to them ſeem inexpedient (which I mean by Gnats) though they cannot but ſtrain at Camels, that is ſuch things, as to them ſeem unlawful. Publick countenance and maintenance, would outweigh matters of indifferency with many men, to whom ſuch things are more than indifferent, even very ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary.</p>
            <p>One good way to make the yoke of Religion eaſie, is to make uſe of as few ſpiritual cords, as may be, to tye men with, but rather of ſuch as are of a civil nature; for thereby the Church and State are more ſecured, and the minds of men leſs ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſperated. It is well known what Churchwardens have ſworn to do, by the oaths which they took at their entrance into that office; but whether it be that they fear to perform what they did fear not to promiſe, (or whatever the reaſon is) we find the intended obligation hath little influence upon them, and they are generally the ſame, as if they had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken no ſuch oaths, which confirms what I was ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>viz.</hi> that Religious obligations, as from ſome men, give the Church and State but little ſecurity, yet do they vex and diſquiet the minds of men, more than thoſe of another nature would do, and greatly imbitter them againſt thoſe by whom they are impoſed upon them againſt their wills.</p>
            <p>It would yet further conduce to the Church its peace, (which is the thing I am earneſtly in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit of throughout this Chapter, though in order to the reſtauration of the City) if it might be taken for a ſufficient proof of mens obedience to the Church and the Officers of it, when men obſerve all the Commands of God, ſeconded by their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority: whoſoever doth what is manifeſtly his du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:45718:78"/>having the Authority both of God and man to induce him thereunto, ſhould be preſumed to have reſpect unto both in the doing it.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, Superiours ſhould ſtudy all they can to give ſatisfaction in matters of Religion, and Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours what in them is to receive it: So Paul <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came all things to all men, that he might win ſome:</hi> He ſaith, he <hi>ſtudied to pleaſe all men for their good to edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</hi> Superiours ſhould impoſe nothing but what upon a true accompt is neceſſary, Act. 15.28. <hi>It ſeemed good to the Holy Ghoſt, and to us, to lay upon you no greater burthen than theſe neceſſary things, &amp;c.</hi> and inferiours ſhould oppoſe nothing, but what they judge unlawful. That which I aim to prove in all that I have herein ſaid is, that ſuch principles and practiſes as I have here recommended (as modeſtly as I could, and with humble ſubmiſſion to better judgements) would much incourage and further the building of the City; which concluſion I draw from theſe two premiſes, <hi>viz.</hi> what would pacifie and ſatisfie men as to matter of Religion, would much promote the reſtoring of the City: But the things ſuggeſted would much pacifie and ſatisfie men, as to matter of Religion. The minor I have proved at large; the major, or firſt Propoſition, I ſhall brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpeak to, and ſo put a period to this Chapter, which for the length of it beyond any other, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly compared to the Antediluvian Patriarchs, we may call <hi>Methuſelah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That quieting the minds of men, as to matters of Religion, would promote the building of the City, I ſhall briefly prove, as followeth. Joy is the ſtrength of men, as one Text ſaith, <hi>The joy of the Lord ſhall be your ſtrength:</hi> Joy makes men <hi>like Gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants refreſhed with Wine, mighty to run their race.</hi> Now certain it is, that to give men content in point of
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:45718:79"/>Religion, would fill them with joy, and make the greateſt Jubilee that hath yet been kept.</p>
            <p>If it be ſaid, that ſome will never be pleaſed with liberty granted to themſelves, unleſs the ſame be denied to all others not of the ſame opinion in all things, though of the ſame Religion in the main, Charity would, that I ſhould think there are but a few ſuch ill natur'd people, and they, of all others, have, and do forfe it their own liberty.</p>
            <p>I have heard of a Senator much condemned for putting a bird to death, at a time when it was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted a <hi>Piaculum</hi> to deſtroy the life of any crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; but he alledging, (if my ill memory do not miſrepreſent the ſtory) that the bird he killed, was one that would not ſuffer other birds to live by him, was thereupon acquitted, (and well he might.) I hope there are but few birds of that feather, at this day, ſince men have ſeen what pecking at, and prey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one upon another, hath brought us to; let him be as <hi>the ſpeckled bird,</hi> (<hi>Jer.</hi> 12.9.) who would have all others made to fly the light, and the Sun to ſhine upon none but himſelf, and thoſe that flock together with him.</p>
            <p>But for the generality of men I dare to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take, that a liberty in common with others (birds of the ſame kind, though not of the ſame feather) that is, perſons of the ſame Religion for ſubſtance, though of different opinion,) would make their hearts more glad, than theirs whoſe corn and wine encreaſe: Then would our City go merrily on, and men would build with a courage, whereas on the other hand, diſſatisfactions as to Religion, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirit men for all good purpoſes, and make them cold and careleſs; whilſt men dream of tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planting, they will have little heart to building: That which makes men liſtleſs to Trade, will make
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:45718:79"/>them ſo to build; and that which qui-ckneth the one, (as to deal tenderly with their Religion, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly doth) will alſo quicken the other. Whilſt ſome upbraid others with their diſſonant Opinions, they will upbraid them again with their diſſolute lives: and thus whilſt we pry into one anothers weakneſſes, and pelt each other with dirt, the City is like to go but ſlowly on, to what it might do, if we had that mutual charity which is ſaid <hi>to cover a multitude of infirmities.</hi> A vexed conſcience, like the paſſion of <hi>jealouſie, is the rage of a man,</hi> and will hardly ſpare in the day of its wrath. A vexed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience will go nigh to diſcover it ſelf one time or other, as they ſay, <hi>vexata natura prodit ſeipſam.</hi> And are men fit to build in a rage? A ſerene mind is fit for any thing, but a mind that is like the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging Sea, will do nothing but caſt up dirt and mire. We read in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 11.13. how that Ephraim <hi>ſhall not envy</hi> Judah, <hi>and</hi> Judah <hi>ſhall not vex</hi> Ephraim. When God ſhall make and perform ſome ſuch promiſe to <hi>England,</hi> then certainly will our City go up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main.</p>

            <argument>
               <p>
                  <hi>That a ſtudious advancing and promoting of Trade by thoſe that have power to do it, would greatly contribute to the Re-building of</hi> London.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>WHat ſhould we do with a City without a Trade? Can men pay great rents, and fines, keep ſervants, &amp;c. with little or no trade? Citizens (as is ſaid of the Fowls of the Air) can neither ſow nor reap <hi>illis nec ſeritur nec metitur</hi> in a literal ſenſe. <hi>London</hi> ſtreets are neither arable nor Paſture. Take away their Trade, and you take their Milſtone to pledg, which is their very life, for ſo a mans lively<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood is ſaid to be. <hi>London</hi> is a Lamp, Trade the Oil that feeds it. What is a Lamp without Oil? Give them but Oil enough, and if others have made them burn, you will make them ſhine again.</p>
            <p>If Trade be deſtroyed, Citizens will be ſtarved, and that will make them deſperate: for <hi>Hunger</hi> (as they ſay) <hi>will break through ſtone walls.</hi> Thoſe Bees will care for no hive, if they can ſuck no honey. If Trades be not the making of men, uſually they are their undoing. If Trading take wings and fly away, they will be gone too. Could Londoners foreſee there would be no Trade, they would preſently ceaſe from building, and betake themſelves to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, where they could profit more both by the earth and by the air, and could live for leſs. No Trade, no City; no City, no Kingdom. Impoveriſh <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> and you impoveriſh the Countrey (for the City doubtleſs was, and is the beſt door of utterance for the Countrey mans beſt Commodities) impoveriſh the Farmer, and you undo both Gentry and Nobility,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:45718:80"/>for what ſhall Landlords live upon, when Tenants cannot pay their rents?</p>
            <p>Who knows not that Trade is that to the Politick Body, that the Circulation of the Bloud (whereby proper nouriſhment is conveyed to every part) is to the Body natural? When the Bloud ſtagnates, or doth not circulate freely, the Body languiſheth. Trade is a Myſtery of gaining by thoſe that do gain by us, and in the ſame Commodity. The Merchant gains by the Drugſter, the Drugſter by the Apothecary, the Apothecary by the Patient, and the Patient by the Apothecary (with the bleſſing of God) though not wealth, yet health, which is better. As friendſhip is upheld in the World by an intercourſe of kindneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and doing of courteſies one for another, ſo the greateſt part of humane ſociety, is upheld by Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce and Traffique, one man needing anothers Commodities, and he his again.</p>
            <p>Trade is as I may call it a grave <hi>Tennis-play,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Ball of profit is banded from one man to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, an exerciſe which moſt men are ſo well pleaſed with, that ſhould they be deprived of it, many men would not much care to be in the World, much leſs in the City. In a word, Trade is the very radical moiſture of <hi>London,</hi> and of other Cities, when that is almoſt dried up, Citizens, like thoſe that are fallen into a Conſumption, or hectick Feaver, will change the Air, and chooſe to be in the Countrey, and to build there, if they build any where. Give Citizens what you will beſides, they will never be content without a Trade, and the reaſon is, becauſe they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be content to ſtarve: as we ſee the Inhabitants of thoſe Towns are ready to do, where the ancient Trade (were it of Cloathing or whatſoever elſe) is almoſt quite loſt. Though Trade would not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent them without any thing elſe, yet I am ſure no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:45718:81"/>elſe would without the acceſſion of a Trade. Men will never believe they have any love for them, who have none for their Trading, and do naturally hate thoſe whom they do but ſuſpect to be enemies thereunto.</p>
            <p>Enemies to Trade (if there be any ſuch Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters) can be no friends to the honour of the King, for to be a King of Beggars muſt needs be a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace, ſith God counts it his honour to be a <hi>King of Kings.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I think the honour, as of a King, ſo of a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is not a little concerned in the welfare of Trade. For a Parliament is a Colledge of State Phyſitians, and Trade hath been their Patient all along (a cachectick, obſtructed Patient) could they cure it at laſt, they would be famous. <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> in the Act for the rebuilding of it, is ſpoken of by the Honourable Title of a place renowned for Traffique and Commerce all the World over: So will the contrivers of that Act be, for their Wiſdom and prudence, when they ſhall bring it to that paſs again.</p>
            <p>Could Londoners regain ſuch a Trade as formerly they have had, they would not grudg to build ſuch a City as might even dazle the eyes of its beholders; but as Trade goes now, they think it is fine enough as it is, and is intended to be, if not too fine.</p>

            <argument>
               <p>
                  <hi>That the beſt way to diſpatch the City, would be to build ſome whole Streets together.</hi>
               </p>
            </argument>
            <p>WEE have yet but a ſcattering Village (as it were) of the new part of <hi>London,</hi> whereas if we had been wiſe, we might have had by this time (almoſt as eaſily) a kind of New City. My mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is this, If the Owners of ground belonging to ſome of the higheſt and nobleſt Streets, had all agreed together to begin, and carry on their buildings all at once, or to part with their ground to others, ſo many of them as were not in a capacity ſo to do) others be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as willing to give them a valuable conſideration for it (as having a regard on both ſides to the publick good) then might we have ſeen ere now, <hi>a New Corn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill, a New Cheapſide</hi> compleat, and entire, and poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ſome other ſtreets of greateſt note and eminency. Theſe would have lookt and ſignified like a new Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or ſome good part of ſuch a thing.</p>
            <p>It is good to make an end of one thing firſt. Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandmen do not uſe to Plow and Sow a part of one Furrow, and a part of another, and ſo of fifty or a hundred before they have finiſhed any one, but count it the beſt Husbandry to Plow and Sow a whole Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row at a time. We ſay, he that is <hi>aliquis in omn bus,</hi> is <hi>nullus in ſingulis,</hi> he that is ſome body in every thing, is good at nothing. He is more a Scholar that is throughly verſed in one Art or Science, than he that hath but ſipt of every one. In like manner, two goodly new Streets would look more like a new <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> than all that is built as yet. I doubt not but they who made the Act for Building did foreſee this, but fearing to be injurious to particular perſons, by
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:45718:82"/>making ſome more forward than they could afford to be, and others more backward than they needed, or were willing to have bin, (who would have thought it unreaſonable to have ſtayed for others, till their houſes had bin firſt built (though ſcituate in more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent places than were their own) thought fit to leave it to the Liberty and Prudence of men to agree amongſt themſelves what might in that particular be moſt for the general good.</p>
            <p>If Workmen and Materials enough could have been procured, or yet may, (which I doubt not) to carry on all, and every houſe at one and the ſame time, in one or two noble ſtreets, and nevertheleſs to ſupply the occaſions of ſcattered buildings, and buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, in other more obſcure places (where a liberty of Building dividedly, and ſucceſſively, were allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) then would the publick convenience no ways in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfere with any mans private intereſt.</p>
            <p>Suppoſe then it were proclaimed, that all and every houſe, in two or three eminent ſtreets ſhould be built at one and the ſame time, and at ſuch a time they would begin, do you think that work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men would not come from all parts of his Majeſties Dominions (if not alſo from Proteſtant Countries beyond the Seas) as not doubting to meet with good and full employment? Now in caſe they ſhould do ſo, there would not want hands to do e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very mans work, as well in private ſtreets, as in thoſe of greater eminency. Bells that ring for Weddings, and other joyful ſolemnities, are rung all together, and then we know they make the beſt muſick, whereas one, and but one Bell at a time, gives the doleful notice of Deaths and Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals. In the caſe I am ſpeaking of, it is not only the more the merrier, but the fewer the worſe chear, contrary to the latter part of our Proverb.
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:45718:82"/>It hath been complained of, that houſes which have been built at ſome diſtance of time from one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, have been apt to ſever and part one from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, and one to ſink before the other were fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, which ſhould make men ambitious to build houſes in the ſame ſtreet at the ſame time, which uſe to agree beſt, as twins are wont to do, who were bred and born, at or near the ſame time. It is beſt that houſes which muſt be contiguous, ſhould be contemporary, and they that muſt ſtand together, ſhould riſe together, and be a collateral ſecurity (if I may ſo call it) each to other.</p>
            <p>Divided houſes (ſome one or ſome few in one ſtreet and ſome in another) do or may ſadly remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber us of divided intereſts, every man ſhifting for himſelf, and ſetting up for himſelf, or ſome few together, like thoſe St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of <hi>Acts</hi> 27.44. who in the time of Ship-wrack, <hi>Some caſt themſelves into the Sea, being able to ſwim, and the reſt, ſome on boards, and ſome on the broken pieces of the Ship, made towards the Land.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Methinks men ſhould ſtrain hard (their credit and purſes, I mean not their conſciences) to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with a common and publick good, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, with building ſome whole ſtreets together, or giving way to others, if that be ſuch. Nature hath taught the lifeleſs elements to quit their proper center when it may be for the good of the univerſe. So Water which naturally inclineth to aſcend, will deſcend to prevent an abhorred <hi>vacuum:</hi> So the Heavenly Spheres though they have a ſlow motion of their own, from Weſt to Eaſt, yet do more ſwiftly accompany the <hi>primum mobile,</hi> or firſt mover from Eaſt to Weſt, as if it were to ſhew us we ſhould be more ſwift in adhering to, and attending upon a publick good, than our own private.</p>
            <pb n="128" facs="tcp:45718:83"/>
            <p>Let it never be ſaid that men will not agree to do what is beſt for themſelves, unleſs they be forc'd to it, for that is juſt like Children: If then it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be for a publick and common good to build ſome whole ſtreets together, let no man oppoſe it with reſpect to his private intereſt, eſpecially, if there be thoſe that would compenſate him for it, for ſo to do, were (according to our Proverb) <hi>To burn other mens Houſes, that we might roaſt our own Eggs.</hi>

            <argument>
               <p>
                  <hi>That our building ought to begin where the fire ended.</hi>
               </p>
            </argument>
            <p>THe Fire made more ends than one, for that it burned both Eaſt and Weſt: but whereſoever it ended, there ſhould we begin to build. The method of fire, and of building, are quite oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite, the firſt is <hi>Analytical,</hi> the latter <hi>Synthetical,</hi> which method begins with the end of things: So one of the firſt queſtions in Theology is, <hi>what is the chief end of man?</hi> The fire went from the middle, (as it were) to the extremes, from <hi>Thame ſtreet</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Tower-ſtreet</hi> on one, and towards the <hi>Temple</hi> on the other hand; but every body knows, that it is better to proceed from extremes to the middle, for <hi>(in medio virtus)</hi> (and that is the method which I commend to be uſed in our building) <hi>viz.</hi> to build firſt at both ends, or extremes of the City, where the fire gave over deſtroying, and ſo to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to the middle, from the two poles (as it were) to the center; as they ſay, <hi>where the natural Phyloſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher ends, there the Phyſitian begins: ubi deſinit Phyſicus, &amp;c.</hi> So where the fire ended, ought the builders to begin.</p>
            <pb n="129" facs="tcp:45718:83"/>
            <p>Now the reaſon of that advice is, becauſe when there are but few houſes in the new City, if they ſtand by themſelves, they will be unſafe, but if they be joyned to the old buildings, (and do ſtand cheek by joul with it) they will be as ſafe and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure as it ſelf.</p>
            <p>Again, houſes ſo built, (I mean contiguous with the old City) will be more commodious for Trade, and that with reſpect both to buyers and ſellers: Buyers will not have far to go for their commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and ſellers (by that means) will have the more cuſtomers, more Chapmen.</p>
            <p>Moreover, to joyn the new part of the City to the old, at both ends, and on both ſides of the way, would make it more ſpeedily to look like a City, even as a quarter of an hours diſcourſe upon new matter, joyned to half an hours repetition of that which is good, and old, paſſeth for a Sermon; whereas a quarter of an hours diſcourſe by it ſelf, would puzzle men what to call it, and be laught at for a ſhort come off. A new City joyned to the old, would be the Embleme of a <hi>ſober comprehenſion,</hi> mannaged to the beſt advantage of Church and State, and of all good men; whereas the ſcattering of houſes ſome here, ſome there, at ſome diſtance one from another, and all at a diſtance from the old building, would be more the Embleme of an <hi>uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal tolleration</hi> taking in Papiſts, Quakers, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry body elſe, and which is beſt of the two, I leave to other men to judge; not to joyn the new and old together, were to make as if they were two diſtinct Cities, whereas indeed they are but two diſtinct parts of one and the ſame City, united under the ſame Governors and Government, and comprized within the ſame wall: Drunken men uſe to ſee things double, which are but ſingle, and it is an ill
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:45718:84"/>deſign to make things ſeem to be more than they are. I love unity, and that it ſhould be owned to be where it is, though I ſhall not curſe the number two (as one of the Ancients did) for firſt wording from it.</p>
            <p>I have given my reaſons why what was laſt in the execution of the fire (burning both wayes) ſhould be firſt in the intention and proſecution of the builder: I will but moralize this head, and diſmiſs it. Sin, like the fire, hath made the greateſt havock in the midſt of us, I mean upon the middle part of our lives, not guarded by a harmleſs ignorance, as was our youth, nor yet by a preventing impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency, (as old age is.) Now the main work of a Chriſtian ſhould begin at the two ends of his life, (for ſo the two extremes may be called, and the phraſe of <hi>our latter end</hi> ſeemeth to imply a former end.) In matter of examination, confeſſion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> a Chriſtian ſhould begin at the beginning, or hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther end of his life: <hi>In ſin was I born, Pſa.</hi> 51. but in point of meditation, it is good to begin at the further or latter end of our lives, (proceeding from thence to ſerious reflections upon the midſt, and worſt of them) as God ſpake by <hi>Moſes,</hi> Deut. 32.29. <hi>O that they were wiſe, that they underſtood this, that they would conſider their latter end.</hi>

            <argument>
               <p>
                  <hi>That it would much conduce to the rebuilding of</hi> Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, <hi>to have a through ſearch made how and by what means it was burnt.</hi>
               </p>
            </argument>
            <p>I Charge no body with the burning of <hi>London,</hi> but him that charged it upon himſelf, that confeſſed, and died for it. But let others produce what they have to ſay: if men will confidently affirm that <hi>London</hi> was deſtroyed, by the treachery, and cruelty of more perſons than that one forementioned miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creant, it is pity but they were puniſhed, if they can produce no probable grounds and reaſons, for what they ſay: But if they have things to alledge in the caſe, which do amount at leaſt to a ſtrong preſumption, and juſt ground of great ſuſpicion, that ſo it was, it is great pity but that ſent ſhould be followed, thoſe footſteps traced, and the utmoſt ſagacity of wiſe, and impartial men, (Magiſtrates and others) imployed to fathom and diſcover what is at the bottom. As <hi>Samuel</hi> ſaid to <hi>Saul, what mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth then this bleating of the ſheep in mine ears, and the lowing of the Oxen which I bear?</hi> So ſay I, what mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that doleful cry, which is daily in our ears, ſuch and ſuch have burnt our City? That is ſoon ſaid, and may be as ſoon denyed, but proof is all in all. Some tell us <hi>There is a great cry but no wooll,</hi> a great ſmoak of accuſation, but no fire (or ſo much as a ſpark) of guilt. <hi>Still I ſay, ſub judice lis eſt:</hi> When the law hath given a perfect lot in the caſe, then, and not till then, ſhall we certainly know who is in the right. That old <hi>dilemma</hi> will never be anſwered: if it be enough to accuſe who can be innocent, if it be ſufficient to excuſe who will ever ſeem guilty?
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:45718:85"/>Therefore there is a third thing that muſt of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity be done and that is tryal to be made, by ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Juries, and the worthy Judges, what validity there is in all, and every the Allegations <hi>pro,</hi> and <hi>con,</hi> given in upon Oath, what all the Plaintiffs can ſay againſt; and all the Defendants can ſay for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, do ſignify and amount to. What moment, all the circumſtances produced and proved, have, and are of in the ballance of reaſon. When that is done, there is reaſon for every man to be ſatisfied, and I hope it will be ſo. Have our Laws provided, that if the deſpicableſt perſon that can be, lye dead in the ſtreets, unknown to any body there preſent, how he or ſhe came by their death, a jury ſhall be impanel'd, and the Coroner ſhall ſit upon it, to give ſentence what the cauſe, of his or her death was? And did not God himſelf by his ſervant <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> will, and command the <hi>Iſralites,</hi> that <hi>if one were found flain in their land, and it were not known who had flain him,</hi> Deut. 21.1. <hi>All the elders of that City which was next unto the ſlain man ſhould waſh their hands over a Heifer that was beheaded and ſay, our hands have not ſhed this bloud, neither have our eyes ſeen it,</hi> v. 6, 7. <hi>And the Prieſts the ſons of Levi ſhall come near, and by their word ſhall every controverſy and every ſtroke be tried,</hi> v. 5. which laſt words ſeem to imply, that the perſons who came to the place where the dead body lay (or the heifer inſtead of the dead body) were not acquitted by thir meer waſhing their hands, in token of innocency (as <hi>Pilate did</hi>) nor yet by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing themſelves not to have ſhed that bloud, or to have known who did, but that the ſons of <hi>Levi</hi> in thoſe daies, had a ſpirit of diſcerning given them, whereby they were able upon ſeeing, and hearing ſuch paſſages, to judge whether the perſons, who appeared to purge themſelves, were guilty, or
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:45718:85"/>not guilty. For the text ſaith, <hi>By their word ſhall every ſtroke be tried.</hi> Did the Law of God inquire ſo ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after the death of every man (the time and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of whoſe death was unknown) and do the laws of our land do the like at this day? and is it not highly reaſonable that the death and deſtruction of a famous City, the greater part of which lies ſlain in the ſtreets to this day, and buried in its own ruines, and aſhes, I ſay that the means and cauſes thereof ſhould be inquired into?</p>
            <p>Nay how great a care did the Law of God take to ſatisfie thoſe husbands (one way or other) upon whom <hi>the ſpirit of jealouſie</hi> came, though there were no witneſs to prove that againſt their wives, which they were jealous of: Yea <hi>if the husband were jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of his wife and ſhe were not defiled, Numb.</hi> 5.13, &amp; 14. Though the thing he was jealous of could not be proved, yea though the woman was not guilty, nevertheleſs ſhe was to offer the <hi>jealouſy offering,</hi> v. 18. to purg her ſelf by an Oath, v. 19. and to drink of the bitter water, v. 18. and all this was no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice to the wife in caſe ſhe were innocent, nay it was an advantage to her, for v. 28. it is ſaid, <hi>If the woman be not defiled but be clean then ſhe ſhall be free,</hi> viz. Firſt from the curſe, or miſchief which the bitter water would otherwiſe have brought upon her, v. 19. <hi>If thou haſt not gone aſide to uncleanneſs be thou free from this bitter water which cauſeth the curſe,</hi> v. 19 Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly from the jealouſy, and ſuſpicion of her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, which would not otherwiſe have been taken off. And one benefit more ſhe was to have by it, expreſſed, v. 28. <hi>And ſhall conceive ſeed,</hi> that is, if ſhe were barren before; ſhe ſhould after that have a Child, and if ſhe had any formerly ſhe ſhould have more. If ſo much were done to ſatisfie the jealouſy of one private man, may nothing reaſonably
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:45718:86"/>be expected to ſatisfie and take off the jealouſies of thouſands, if not millions of men and women, in City and country, in a matter of higher conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, than is that injury which a husband re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth by the unchaſtneſs of his wife? (though that injury be very great, yet this I ſay was greater:) For this was a fault not to be pardoned if proved, whereas <hi>Joſeph</hi> though a juſt man when he ſuſpected his eſpous'd wife, to have been unlawfully with Child, thought to have paſt it by, and not to have made her an example, <hi>Mat.</hi> 1.</p>
            <p>How deſirous were the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> that were ſmote with Emrods to know, <hi>whither God had done them that great evil, or whether it were not ſome chance</hi> that had hapned to them, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6.9. Was their Plague of Emrods greater than our plague of Fire? If not, why ſhould we leſs inqure after this how it came than they after that?</p>
            <p>To inform our ſelves how the Fire came to paſs, is not a point of curioſity, but of great uſe. For could it be made out (at leaſtwiſe with great proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility) that it was the immediate hand of God, and as it were Fire from Heaven, that did conſume our City, that circumſtance would ſo much promote our humiliation, to think that (rather than ſuffer us to go unpuniſhed,) God ſhould work a miracle to deſtroy us.</p>
            <p>And then again upon other accounts, it might make much for our comfort, to know that men had no hand in the doing of it. For if God himſelf did do it immediately, we may hope the like will not be done again, in many ages to come. For as God, after he had once drowned the world, did preſently promiſe he would do ſo no more: ſo it is ſcarcely to be paraleld amongſt the providences of God, that he ſhould burn the ſame City twice in a ſhort
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:45718:86"/>time. He uſeth to pauſe, and as it were to delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate long, upon ſuch ſtrange acts of Judgment, as thoſe are, expoſtulating with himſelf, and with them as of old: <hi>How ſhall I give thee up O Ephraim? how ſhall I make thee like Admah, and like Zeboim, my bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els are turned within me,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But they that ſuſpect it was burnt by men, till that jealouſie be removed, will always be in fear, that they whom they miſtruſt to have deſtroyed it once, if undiſcovered, will attempt to deſtroy it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, as ſoon and as often as they can. Now in caſe the bitter water of a through examination ſhall confirm the thing they were jealous of, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>London</hi> was fired by Inſtruments, and it ſhall come to light who thoſe Inſtruments were, it is all the reaſon in the world they ſhould be made examples, that others may hear, and fear, and do no more ſo wickedly. I reckon the danger would be over (for one Age at leaſt) as to that ſort of men that ſhould once be proved and owned to have burnt the City, ſo firmly as they would be bound to their good beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, and ſo watchful an eye as would be held over them from that time forward.</p>
            <p>All oppoſition made to the ſifting out that buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, doth vehemently encreaſe the jealouſies of men; for <hi>he that doth well cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifeſt; but they that have done evil hate the light, leſt their deeds of darkneſs ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved.</hi> One would think that whotſoever is ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected (being indeed innocent) ſhould be more earneſt than any other perſons to come to a ſtrict ſcrutiny, that themſelves might be vindicated. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks the chaſt Wife that had a jealous Husband, ſhould and could not but long for the bitter water, as knowing it would be ſo far from cauſing her belly to ſwell, and her thigh to rot, that it would keep
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:45718:87"/>her name from rotting, and make her of a ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſuſpected Wife, to become a joyful Mother. If all men can waſh their hands in innocency, as from the burning of <hi>London,</hi> I heartily wiſh <hi>that God would bring forth their righteouſneſs as the light, and their judgement as the noon day.</hi> It is pity they ſhould ſuffer ſo much as in their names, who had no hand in it, and if any had, beſides that poor <hi>Hubart,</hi> who was executed upon that accompt (the ſtrangeſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance that ever was if he burnt ſuch a City alone) to ſuffer in their names only is not ſufficient.</p>
            <p>But now I think of it, there lately came down a Command, or Commiſſion to the City, to take ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aminations upon oath of all matters relating to the fire, which was done accordingly, and the injun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to do it was I know accepted with all hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thankfulneſs, and as well reſented by many, as ever any thing was. That conſidered, I muſt excuſe what I have ſaid with that of the Poet, He that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commends what is done already, thereby com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends him that did it. <hi>Qui monet facias quod jam facis ille monendo laudat.</hi> What <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther caſe, I ſhall allude to in this: After ſo much enquiry as hath been made already, upon the oaths of ſufficient perſons, (many of whoſe depoſitions are now extant,) and after all that are like to be hereafter made, by vertue of the Authority then granted, if there be any guilt at the bottom, <hi>Whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever hideth it hideth the wind, and the oyntment of his right hand which bewrayeth it ſelf, Prov.</hi> 27.16.</p>

            <argument>
               <p>
                  <hi>That the countenance of Rulers, expreſſing much zeal and earneſtneſs to have the City up again, and a ſad ſenſe of its preſent ruines, would put much life into the work.</hi>
               </p>
            </argument>
            <p>BLeſſed be God, and bleſſed of the Lord be they, for all that countenance, which by thoſe that are in Authority, hath been given to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>building of <hi>London,</hi> and particularly by that moſt prudent Act of theirs, which was made for that end and purpoſe: That by that Act <hi>Londoners</hi> were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed but a Copy-hold Leaſe of time, <hi>viz.</hi> the term of three years, for rebuilding of the City, was enacted upon no evil deſign, ſuch as to ſurprize and take advantage againſt them, for not being able to finiſh the work in ſo ſhort a time; but with a full intent to renew their Leaſe, at or before the expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of it, (if need ſhould be) and that upon bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter conditions than the former, as experience ſhould inform them of any thing that might be better. Sure I am, <hi>London</hi> had hitherto been like a Tree that ſtands in the ſhade, if the beams of Authority had not ſhone upon it ſo as they have done, it had not been in that good forwardneſs that it is at this day.</p>
            <p>What if it be the true intereſt of our Rulers and Governours, (as doubtleſs it is) that <hi>London</hi> ſhould be rebuilt with all convenient ſpeed? are they therefore neither praiſe nor thank worthy for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributing their aſſiſtance? If Magiſtrates eſpouſe the intereſt of Religion, and cheriſh it both in themſelves and others, in ſo doing they ſhall pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:45718:88"/>their own intereſt upon the beſt terms, (for God will honor thoſe that honor him) yet for ſo doing, all good men will acknowledge, we ought to praiſe and thank them more than for any thing elſe.</p>
            <p>I need not tell our Rulers (whoſe intereſt I have elſewhere proved it is, that <hi>London</hi> ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>built) that great works go on but ſlowly without countenance from Magiſtrates, and ordinarily as ſwiftly with it, when they afford not only permiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and connivance, but Commiſſion and counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance. Our Proverb ſaith, <hi>The Maſters eye makes the horſe fat.</hi> Of the Temple it is ſaid, <hi>Ezra</hi> 6.14. <hi>They builded and finiſhed it according to the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of</hi> Cyrus <hi>and</hi> Darius, <hi>and</hi> Artaxerxes, <hi>King of Perſia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How vigorouſly <hi>Cyrus,</hi> though a Heathen Prince, did beſtir himſelf for and towards the rebuilding of the Temple of <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> We are told almoſt throughout the ſixth Chapter of the Book of <hi>Ezra.</hi> and as if <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> had vyed with <hi>Cyrus</hi> for zeal in that matter, or laboured to out ſtrip him: We read as much of him in the ſeventh Chapter, from the 11th verſe, till towards the end. If either of them had had a Palace of his own to build, which his heart had been greatly ſet upon, I ſee not how he could have promoted it more than both of them did the Temple. Ezra. 7.23. <hi>Whatſoever is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by the God of Heaven, let it be diligently done,</hi> (<hi>ſaid</hi> Artaxerxes <hi>in his Decree</hi>) <hi>for the Houſe of the God of Heaven; for why ſhould there be wrath againſt the Realm of the King?</hi> Under thoſe benigne aſpects and influences of great ones, the Temple went up amain; and ſo doubtleſs (with the bleſſing of God) may our City, if the like countenance and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement from ſuch as are in chief Authority ſhall always be afforded to it.</p>
            <pb n="139" facs="tcp:45718:88"/>
            <p>And what ſhould make us doubt but ſo it will be? For firſt, our Rulers know full well, that nothing will be reſcented as a greater demonſtration of their love and care, than an earneſt forwardneſs expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to ſee <hi>London</hi> up again, (or of the contrary, man a want of that) nothing will beget a greater confidence of the people in them, and affection to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, than that would do.</p>
            <p>Beſides that, it is more their own concern, in point of Honor and profit, that <hi>London</hi> ſhould be built again, than it is the concern of any ten men whatſoever, as his Majeſty was pleaſed to ſay in print, That his loſs, by the burning of <hi>London,</hi> was greater than any mans elſe; and certainly it was. Was not his Majeſty the great Landlord, to whom all the houſes in <hi>London</hi> had wont to pay a kind of Quit-Rent, (othergiſe than a Pepper-Corn) <hi>viz.</hi> ſo much yearly for every Chimney? Private men may call this, or that, or ſome few houſes in <hi>London</hi> theirs, but only the Kings of <hi>England</hi> can call <hi>London</hi> their City. (as they uſe to do) (though not in ſuch a ſenſe as to deſtroy the propriety of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar owners) But though owners have more intereſt in ſome houſes, Kings have ſome in all, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſaid of any Subject: Neither is that of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit which Kings have had by the City of <hi>London</hi> ſo great, but the intereſt of honor and reputation, which hath accrued to them by their dominion over ſo famous a City (the very quinteſſence of their Kingdoms) hath been as great, or greater: All which things conſidered, it were not unreaſonable, or effeminate, if a King ſhould openly lament the loſs of ſuch a City, in ſome ſuch language, as <hi>David</hi> did the loſs of <hi>Abſalom,</hi> when he cryed out, <hi>O</hi> Abſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lom, Abſalom, <hi>my Son</hi> Abſalom, <hi>O</hi> Abſalom, <hi>my Son, my Son.</hi> O <hi>London, London,</hi> my City, my City, &amp;c. I
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:45718:89"/>ſhould think the loſs of <hi>London</hi> to be as great as was that of <hi>Callice,</hi> which one Queen of <hi>England</hi> laid ſo much to heart.</p>
            <p>Should then our Rulers expreſs ſuch a paſſion for <hi>London,</hi> as <hi>David</hi> did for <hi>Abſalom,</hi> or as <hi>Rachel</hi> is ſaid to have done for the loſs of her children (as hardly any caſe would better bear it) or ſhould they ſay concerning <hi>London,</hi> as <hi>Rachel</hi> concerning children before ſhe had any, <hi>Give me children, or I die.</hi> Methinks I eaſily foreſee, how the generality of the people would do as <hi>Davids</hi> valiant men did, who <hi>brake through an Hoſt of Philiſtims, and drow wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter out of the Well of</hi> Bethlehem, <hi>and brought it to</hi> Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, <hi>becauſe he longed for it,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23.15. My mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is, if Rulers ſhall expreſs ſuch an earneſt long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after another <hi>London,</hi> as <hi>David</hi> did after the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> people would adventure life, and all, but they ſhould ſoon have it; and the reaſon is, becauſe Rulers in ſo paſſionately wiſhing for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother City, would expreſs kindneſs to the people, as well as to themſelves; and people in purſuing ſo good a work, would ſhew kindneſs to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as well as to their Rulers, the grateful ſenſe of whoſe love they are ambitious to expreſs; and when all thoſe things ſhould meet together, it would be as when ſtream, and wind, and tide, (and that a Spring-tide too) do all concur to promote a Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel that is ſailing, or Galley that goes with Oars.</p>
            <p>When the incouragement of Magiſtrates, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the intereſt and inclinations of a people, do all run one way, then are people <hi>like Gyants re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhed with wine,</hi> who though mighty of themſelves, are made thereby more mighty to run their Race. Had <hi>David</hi> been to build ſuch a City as <hi>London,</hi> I know what <hi>Abſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lom</hi> would have ſaid, (and many
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:45718:89"/>people would have believed him) by what I read of him, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.4. <hi>viz.</hi> that if it were as much in his, as in the power of ſome other, they ſhould not ſtay long for another City: It is not fit for any man to boaſt as he boaſted; <hi>Go too, ſaith S.</hi> James, <hi>ye that ſay we will go to ſuch a City, and continue there a year, and get gain, James</hi> 4.13. Much more might he have checkt thoſe that ſhould ſay by ſuch a time, they would build ſuch a great City: but moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it is, that ſuch a work might be greatly expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and will be ſo, when Rulers ſhall pleaſe to act in it (as natural Agents always do) <hi>ad extremum vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium,</hi> to the utmoſt of their power, and to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent upon it, as if amongſt their earthly concerns, it were for the preſent, <hi>the one thing neceſſary.</hi> Their real ſo expreſſed, would doubtleſs provoke many, and incourage all.</p>

            <head>DISCOURSE XXII.</head>
            <argument>
               <p>
                  <hi>That the choice of worthy men into places of Power, both in City and Country, would contribute much to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>building of</hi> London.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>ALl Power in <hi>England</hi> is not conveyed by Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and choice of the people, neither is it ſit it ſhould. The Supreme Power, <hi>viz.</hi> that of the King, as alſo the power of the Nobility in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is not Elective, but (as I may call it) Native, that which they are not choſen, but born to (that I may avoid his expreſſion (as fearing he ſhewed his wit more than his grace) who ſaid, that the Nobles in Parliament were called, but not choſen.) Surely the hereditarineſs of the Crown in <hi>England</hi> (and ſome other places) is an end of much ſtrife, which would reſult from popular elections, upon every
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:45718:90" rendition="simple:additions"/>vacancy, or deceaſe of the ſupreme magiſtrate. Witneſs the many late confuſions in the Kingdom of <hi>Poland,</hi> which is conferred by election.</p>
            <p>But ſetting aſide thoſe two orders, or eſtates (as ſome call them) <hi>viz.</hi> King, and Nobles, which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the conſtitution of <hi>England,</hi> have a birth-right in power) all others derive their offices, and power from the choice, and appointment, either of the King, or people; as Judges, Parliament men, Mayors, Sheriffs, Barliffs, &amp;c. Moſt of theſe and of the reſt that are inveſted with power, are made by the choice of the people, and much the leſſer part come by their authority, any other way.</p>
            <p>Now for that there is great reaſon, <hi>viz.</hi> that they who chuſe for the people, ſhould be choſen by them. So Orphans have leave to chuſe their own gardians, and malefactors themſelves have a power of refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ſuch Jury-men as they do not like, becauſe when accepted of they muſt ſtand to their verdict:</p>
            <p>As for thoſe who are born to rule (according to the laws of <hi>England</hi>) it is not in the people to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent their power, they can only pray that God would make them, <hi>juſt, ruling in the fear of God,</hi> as it is ſaid they that rule over men ought to be.</p>
            <p>But as for others (and they are the greater part) who cannot get into the ſaddle of power unleſs the people hold the ſtyrop for them, or who are made, or to be made, by the election of the people, if they be not ſuch as they ought to be, the people may thank themſelves. If having two ſorts of men ſet before them, one very good, the other very bad, (as were <hi>Jeremy</hi>'s figs, <hi>Jer.</hi> 24.2.) they will chuſe the bad, and refuſe the good, it is their own fault: and they are like to pay dearly for it, as thoſe wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men uſe to do who withſtand good motions, one after another; and at length caſt away themſelves
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:45718:90" rendition="simple:additions"/>upon ſome vain Prodigal, who will imbezzle their eſtates, and undoe both them and theirs. Methinks the Pſalmiſts language is not too ſharp; to be uſed in this caſe, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 94.8. <hi>Underſtand ye brutiſh amongſt the people, and ye fools when will ye be wiſe?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Do you think that bad Magiſtrates, if you ſhall chuſe ſuch, will cordially help to build a good City? <hi>Solomon</hi> telleth us, that <hi>Every wiſe woman buildeth her houſe, but the fooliſh plucketh it down with her hands, Prov.</hi> 14.11. Unwiſe rulers may be good at pulling down, but not at building up. The choice of ill magiſtrates is like a fault made in the firſt concoction, which can never be repaired in either of the two later. It is an errour in the foundation which can never be mended in the ſuperſtructure.</p>
            <p>I am not of their mind who ſay <hi>Dominium tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porale fundatur in gratiâ,</hi> that none ought to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted with power but thoſe that appear to have ſaving grace. Grace is indeed excellent in a magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, but morallity only is eſſential unto being good in an office, and that to be ſure is. He that ſhall uſe but the office of a Deacon (this mean of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice in the Church) it is ſaid of him, that <hi>he muſt be grave, not given to much wine, not greedy of filthy lucre, that he muſt be proved and found blameleſs,</hi> 1 Tim. 3.8. Now what magiſtrate (properly ſo called) is not intruſted with more power than he that is a Deacon in the Church? and therefore ought not to be defective in the mean qualifications of one that is but a Deacon. Some have ſeemed to think that any thing is good enough to make a Magiſtrate, contrary to that old proverb, <hi>E quovis ligno non fit Mercurius.</hi> Who can make Gods of Devils: now Magiſtrates in the Scripture are called Gods, but diſſolute men are little better than Devils, and may be called <hi>Satan,</hi> a thouſand times, upon as
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:45718:91"/>great, or greater reaſons, as <hi>Peter</hi> was once ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by our Saviour, ſaying to him, <hi>get thee behind me Satan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is more than Egyptian idolatry (in ſome ſenſe) to deify what is worſe than leeks and onions. The people that make ſuch Gods are like unto them. Admit the Gods you make be of gold, and ſilver (whereas ſome it may be are of no better ſtuff, then was the lower part of <hi>Nebuchadnezars</hi> Image) will the richneſs of the mettal be a ſufficient excuſe, why then were the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> puniſhed for worſhipping a golden Calf? Think not if a man have wealth enough, he is preſenly fit to make a Magiſtrate: you would be loth to chuſe him for a pilot (eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in a ſtorm) that hath no skill in ſea-faring af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, becauſe he hath more goods in the ſhip than moſt other men, or to take him for the Phyſician in a dangerous diſtemper, who underſtands not the cure of any one diſeaſe, becauſe a man of great eſtate, or your good Landlord. A Magiſtrate may better want an inheritance, than want wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, though both together would beſt accompliſh him. We read of a poor wiſe man that ſaved a City, but never of a rich fool that did any ſuch thing. All will confeſs that Magiſtrates ſhould be ſober men, and that they may be ſuch, all men ſhould be ſober when they chuſe them, elſe their choice may be ſuch that their beſt excuſe may be that they were drunk when they made it. That corporation is like to reel, and ſtagger, whoſe of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers are choſen by drunken men, or by many that are ſuch, at the making of their choice. Defeat not the ends which are, that <hi>Magiſtrates ſhould be a terror to evil doers; but an incouragement to them that do well.</hi> Put not a ſword into the hands of madmen, leaſt they ſheath it in your own bowels: know that
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:45718:91"/>
               <hi>Moſes,</hi> as well as <hi>Aaron,</hi> ſhould have a kind of <hi>Urim</hi> and <hi>Thummim,</hi> or what thoſe words ſignifie, <hi>viz.</hi> light of knowledg, and integrity of life.</p>
            <p>They that have both of them, will doubtleſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute their utmoſt help to the rebuilding of our City. For they that are ſuch, will concern them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for the good of their Kingdoms; yea of the whole proteſtant World, which I have proved doth much depend upon the being, and well being of <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And verily it is much that Magiſtrates (with the bleſſing of God) may do towards the welfare of a nation (much more of one City) when they are generally ſet upon it, they having the power of a nation in their hands, as High Sheriffs are ſaid to have the <hi>poſſe comitatus</hi> or power of a county. As the other ſpheres are carried about with the <hi>primum mobile,</hi> ſo are the people by the Magiſtrates. They are as it were the muſcles of a nation, which move the body politick, how and which way they pleaſe. Rulers in Scripture are called ſhepherds, and good ſhepherds will no doubt provide a fold for their flock. They are alſo called builders (as where we read of <hi>the ſtone which the builders refuſed</hi>) and queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onleſs, they will be found to be maſter-builders of our ruinous <hi>London,</hi> who are indeed good Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates. You may elect ſuch men into places of power and authority, as would more rejoyce to ſee <hi>London</hi> burn't than built again, for ſuch ſpirits there are abroad (witneſs the triumphs of ſome after the laſt fire) You may again elect others (as places ſhall be vacated by death or otherwiſe) who will be as intent upon the building of the City, as the Jews were of old upon the building of <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> and the Temple of God therein. I have preſented you with both chuſe you whither.</p>

            <argument>
               <p>
                  <hi>That one good way to promote our City, would be to oblige our Governors (all we can) to put to their helping hand.</hi>
               </p>
            </argument>
            <p>I Would not have Rulers be ſinfully diſobliged upon any terms. We ought not to provoke them that are in authority over us (unleſs conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence provoke us to do, what will accidentally, but not intentionally provoke them) <hi>that not only for wrath but for conſcience ſake.</hi> Rulers are parents <hi>(patres patriae)</hi> and if children muſt not be provoked to wrath by their parents, much leſs ought parents to be ſo ſerved by their children.</p>
            <p>Away with thoſe <hi>Chams,</hi> who are all for uncover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their fathers nakedneſs, and thoſe ſcurrilous Pamphlets which deſign nothing elſe; tell not thoſe things in <hi>Gath,</hi> publiſh them not in the ſtreets of <hi>Aſhkelon,</hi> though (with <hi>Cham</hi>) you had ſeen them, which you never did: Take the garment of love and dutifulneſs, lay it upon your ſhoulders, and though you go backward, and the face of your pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice cannot be towards them, (or anſwer to theirs, as doth face to face in a glaſs) yet cover their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs, in a ſenſe alluding to what you read of <hi>Shem</hi> and <hi>Japhet, Gen.</hi> 9.23. To reſtore thoſe that are overtaken in a fault (one or more) with a ſpirit of meekneſs, is a very obliging thing, eſpecially when Inferiours ſhall do this to Superiours, for this is for children to have the heart of a Father, which is more than for Parents to have a heart like them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; for it is harder for love to aſcend, than to deſcend. Mourn for their ſins in ſecret, but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim them not, much leſs aggravate them: It may
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:45718:92"/>be they will cover your offences more eaſily, (which are ſuch to them) if you will cover theirs; and will do more for you, if you will ſpeak leſs againſt them; that good rule, <hi>ſpeak evil of no man,</hi> will juſtifie your ſilence, as to ſuch matters.</p>
            <p>There are greater obligations that may and ought to be laid upon thoſe that govern us, than is our forbearance to ſpeak evil of them, or to upbraid them with whatſoever men think they are upbraid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able: for over and above that, it behoveth us in the firſt place to take thankful notice, and make an open acknowledgment of all the good that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we ſee in them, or receive from them. God who is infinitely our Superiour, doth ſo by us; for ſpeaking of <hi>Abijah,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>That in him only there was found ſome good thing towards the Lord in the houſe of Jeroboam.</hi> If God do this to his inferiours, ought not we to do the like to our Superiours? this being a point of honour, and of reſpect, which to ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours from inferiours is much more due, than to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeriours from ſuperiours: Many would do more good than they do, if the good they have done were more generally owned and incouraged.</p>
            <p>Admit we ſhould put the beſt conſtruction the nature of the thing could bear, upon thoſe actions of Rulers which ſeem liable to more conſtructions than one, would not that our candour oblige them? We hold our ſelves ingaged to thoſe, that will make the beſt that can be made of what we ſay and do: <hi>Charity be lieveth all things, hopeth all things,</hi> (which there is any colour of reaſon to believe and hope) and charity queſtionleſs is due to ſuperiours, as well as from them to inferiours. It was unkindly ſaid by <hi>Eliab</hi> to his Brother <hi>David, I know thy pride, and the haughtineſs of thy heart, for thou art come down to ſee the battel,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 17.28. when indeed he came
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:45718:93"/>upon no worſe a deſign, than to bring proviſion to his Brethren from <hi>Jeſſe</hi> their Father, and by his Command. Overmuch jealouſie expreſſed, doth but prompt and provoke men to thoſe evil things which they did never before intend, and deter them from doing that good which they might, and would have done, if it had been manifeſtly expected from them. When <hi>Paul</hi> would invite <hi>Agrippa</hi> to the Faith, ſee how he inſinuates, Act. 26.27. <hi>King</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grippa <hi>believeſt thou the Prophets, I know that thou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveſt. Then</hi> Agrippa <hi>ſaid to</hi> Paul, <hi>almoſt thou perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt me to be a Chriſtian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Ingenious perſons are loth to fruſtrate that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of good which others have from them, and count it a point of gratitude, for the good opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion they have conceived of them, to fulfil what they expect. The ſmallneſs of our expectance from God is one reaſon why we receive no more good from his hand, (for ſaith God <hi>open thy mouth wide and I will fill it</hi>) and it may be a cauſe ſometimes why men do no more for us. I am ſure, miſtruſt ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times brings that evil, which elſe had never come. So the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> miſtruſting they ſhould never get through the wilderneſs, was that which provoked God to let their carcaſſes fall there. They could not enter into the good land, and why? but becauſe of their unbelief: There is doubtleſs a good <hi>medium</hi> betwixt being too ſuſpicious, and too ſecure; and the leſs needleſly ſuſpicious of them that govern us, and the more candid we are in conſtruing their actions and intentions, the more we do, and ſhall oblige them. As the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>haſt thou faith? have it to thy ſelf,</hi> ſo would I ſay to them that cannot quit their minds of diſobliging fears, built upon but ſlender grounds, haſt thou fear (of that kind) have it to thy ſelf, that is keepe it to thy ſelf and
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:45718:93"/>do not provoke or diſturb others with it.</p>
            <p>Spare not to divulg, and manifeſt all the hopes that are, or can be in you, that perſons in authority will not be wanting to the rebuilding of the City: cheriſh not the leaſt ſuſpicion to the contrary, ſo ſhall they be obliged to be as well by your expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, implying a dependance upon their clemency, and goodneſs, as by the great importance of that deſign.</p>
            <p>Shew a readineſs to obey Rulers, and Governours in whatſoever you think you ſhall not diſobey God. <hi>Children obey your parents in all things,</hi> Col. 3.20. that is in all lawful things, for in <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.1. there is added <hi>in the Lord.</hi> Magiſtrates are civil parents, and how can they chuſe (if Chriſtians) but love thoſe people who never refuſe, or boggle at any of their commands, but ſuch as are really countermanded by their conſciences? which to go againſt, were ſin in them, though they were erroneous and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>informed. I wonder what Father having Sons and Daughters that would never diſpleaſe him, but for fear of diſpleaſing God, would not hold himſelf bound to do all he could for ſo obedient children.</p>
            <p>Patience under thoſe ſufferings which men are not conſcious to themſelves they have deſerved (as if it happen that men ſuffer for doing what conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, their own I mean, bids them do) is another excellent way to win, and gain upon the hearts of Rulers, and to oblige them to do their utmoſt for thoſe that are under their authority. This is a hard leſſon, but the Holy Ghoſt teacheth it, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.19, 20. <hi>For this is thank worthy, if a man for conſcience to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God endure grief, ſuffering wrongfully. But if when ye do well, and ſuffer for it ye take it patiently, this is acceptable with God.</hi> For this the example of Chriſt is propoſed to us, <hi>who when he was reviled (cauſeleſty,)
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:45718:94"/>reviled not again, when he ſuffered, threatned not; but committed himſelf to him that judgeth righteouſly,</hi> v. 23.</p>
            <p>I would not that men ſhould expoſe themſelves to thoſe ſufferings which may without ſin be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided, for ſo to do is not patience but phrenſy, not meekneſs but madneſs. Chriſt gave leave and order to his diſciples, <hi>if they were perſecuted in one City to flie to another.</hi> If men be injur'd againſt Law, they may flie to the Laws of their land to right them; but if the Law it ſelf be againſt men, and ſeem to be injurious to them, there is no ſin in flying from it, nor no lawful avoiding of it, ordinarily, but by flight, as there is no armour that can defend a Cannon bullet, or way to be out of the danger of it, but by keeping out of its way. But when the caſe is ſo that men cannot fly either to the Law (becauſe againſt them) or from the Law, becauſe their cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances will not permit them ſo to do, (their wings are clipt) ſo that they are under a neceſſity of ſuffering to avoid ſinning (at leaſtwiſe againſt their own conſciences) I ſay when it is ſo with men (as the caſe is very ordinary) that the provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God hath brought them under a neceſſity of ſuffering (as they think for righteouſneſs ſake) would they then imitate Chriſt who was <hi>as a ſheep dumb before the ſhearers, he opened not his mouth,</hi> his voice was not heard in the ſtreets, &amp;c. Would they inſtead of rendring evil for evil, <hi>love their enemies, bleſs them that curſe them, pray for them that uſe them deſpightfully</hi> (as they interpret it) that were the likelieſt way to make friends of them, whom they take for their foes, and to ingage them for, who have been ingaged againſt them. Who doth not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member <hi>Sauls</hi> words to <hi>David, Thou art more righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous than I,</hi> extorted by the clemency of <hi>David</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him, who might have avenged himſelf upon
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:45718:94"/>him and would not, who might have taken his life, and took but the lap of his garment. If ſufferings fall ſhort of undoing perſons, and families, I may hope that patience I have pleaded for may be exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed, but if it come to that, I may rather wiſh than hope, that what I have ſaid might take place. But let us rather think, that Chriſtian patience exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed under leſſer puniſhments, will ſo mollifie thoſe by whom they are inflicted (for cauſes not altogether indiſputable) that it will never come to that, yea that the enemies of ſuch meek, and quiet ſufferers, touched with the hardneſs of their caſe and ſoftneſs of their Spirits, and eſpecially by the hand of him who turneth the hearts of men, as the rivers of water which way he pleaſeth, may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come their friends, and do more for, than ever they have done againſt them. For patience under ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, the deſert whereof is not ſo manifeſt, is (as I ſaid at firſt) a moſt obliging thing, and apt to overcome the hearts of thoſe by whom puniſhments are inflicted, and to provoke them to double kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs as it were by way of compenſation.</p>
            <p>That way of obliging Governors which cometh next to hand is by rendering honour to all, and every of them, proportionable to the dignity of their reſpective places, and conſequently a ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative honour to them that are ſupreme in power. To do otherwiſe is a moſt provoking thing, as for inſtance it would be to give more reſpect to a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Colonel, and to aſcribe greater things to him, than to him that were his General, and commander of the whole Army. <hi>Saul</hi> could never forget but did always ſtomack it, that they had ſung in their dances that <hi>Saul had ſlain his thouſands, but David his ten thouſands:</hi> Whereas <hi>Saul</hi> was a King, and <hi>David</hi> then but a ſubject. He that would oblige his King
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:45718:95"/>muſt honour him, as ſuch, and what is that but to honour him more than any other man, and no other man ſo much as him: and that as he is his King; loyal honour, being like conjugal love, which then only is ſincere, when it is ſuperlative.</p>
            <p>Contrary to that honour we owe to governors, not only as ſupreme, but as ſuch, <hi>viz.</hi> as Governors though in a lower orb, is our doing any thing in ſuch a way, and manner, as may imply a contempt of them, which to make ſhew of, is a moſt diſobliging thing. Contempt ordinarily is not ſo much expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the matter of an action, as in the manner of doing, one man may ſteal in the moſt private way he can, meerely to ſatisfie his hunger, and in that theft of his, though the ſin be great, no contempt of the Law, or Magiſtrate, is either expreſſed, or intended, but he that having mony enough, ſhall rob a judge, at noon day, knowing who he is, aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vates his offence by a manifeſt contempt of Law, and Juſtice. And here that rule holds true, <hi>cum duo faciunt idem non eſt idem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Conſcience may prompt men to ſome things, which for the matter of them, are a breach of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane lawes, and yet not to the doing of them in any ſuch manner, as may be conſtrued a contempt. Thoſe that are led by their judgments to baptize none but thoſe that are at years of diſcretion, and to do it by burying their whole body for a time un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der water, may chuſe ſuch private times, and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces for it, that though it be not altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known they do ſuch things, yet none can think themſelves affronted, or intended to be affronted, and offended by what they do.</p>
            <p>Magiſtrates cannot but take it kindly when thoſe that do not keep ſome of their Laws, for fear of offending God, yet will not ſo break them neither,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:45718:95"/>as may needleſly offend them; ſo manifeſting at once a reverent fear both of God and of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, and that if it were poſſible they would pleaſe both. This way of obliging Rulers I commend to all diſſenters, and to imitate that good woman who fearing to diſpleaſe Chriſt, with touching the hem of his garment (though ſhe meant well in the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it) came behind him, and would not have been known of it, if any thing could have been concealed from him to whom ſhe did it.</p>
            <p>What if men ſhould turn a deaf ear to thoſe fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rumors which tend to the diſgrace of perſons that are in Authority? would not that be one way to oblige them? Surely it is but our duty ſo to do: for when the queſtion is put, <hi>who ſhall abide in Gods tabernacle?</hi> Pſ. 15.1. one anſwer is, <hi>He that taketh not up a reproach againſt his neighbour,</hi> v. 3. Moreover it is written, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.19. <hi>Againſt an Elder receive not an accuſation but before,</hi> (or under, as it is in the margent) <hi>two or three witneſſes.</hi> Witneſſes upon Oath we may preſume them to be which are there in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, and if under two, or three ſuch, an accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhould not be received againſt an Elder, why ſhould not as much reſpect be ſhewn to a Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate? We ſhould not be ſwift to hear matters of that nature, but yet more ſlow to ſpeak, deaf we ſhould be in thoſe caſes, but yet more dumb. In ſtead of incouraging ſuch ſtories as thoſe, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet brings in <hi>Jer.</hi> 20.10. <hi>Report ſay they and we will report:</hi> we ſhould put men in mind of the fifth Commandment, <hi>Honour thy Father and thy Mother</hi> (intended of political parents as well as natural) Now what Son that honoureth his Father, would take up a ſlight report againſt him, and report it again? nay, would not labour to ſilence and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs all diſgraceful rumours, of and concerning
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:45718:96"/>him, though he knew them to be true? I dare ſay that Magiſtrates ſhall take them for their friends, and count themſelves beholden to them, who ſhall do as much for them, though it be but their duty as I ſaid before.</p>
            <p>If thoſe who in publick congregations are the mouthes of the people to God, would pray fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, and fervently, and with all demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of reverence, and affection, for all that are in authority: and if the people (whoſe mouths they are) ſhall ſeem to be greatly affected with ſuch pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions as are offered to God on the behalf of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates, and to have an earneſt paſſion for the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment thereof, thereby they would greatly oblige their governours, and they alſo would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent it, as a great obligation, as in it ſelf it is. This is but what by the command of God we are obliged to do, witneſs that text, <hi>I exhort that prayer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> and ſupplications and interceſſions be made for all men, for Kings and for all that are in authority,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.1. It is happy for us that we may oblige our Rulers and ſatisfie our own obligation both under one. When Jeſus wept for <hi>Lazarus, then ſaid the Jews behold how he loved him,</hi> John 11. Will not Rulers infer we love them, if as Chriſt, in the dayes of his fleſh, <hi>did <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ffer up prayers with ſtrong crying and tears:</hi> ſo we ſhall offer up ſuch ſupplications as thoſe on their behalf? but eſpecially if with our petitions we ſhall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixe <hi>thanksgivings</hi> (namely for any mercy we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy under them) for ſo the Apoſtle exhorteth, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.1.</p>
            <p>A ſtudiouſneſs to pleaſe without flattery (as was the Apoſtles practiſe, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.33.) and a ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out things that may be acceptable to Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours <hi>(as we read that the preacher ſought out acceptable words)</hi> and yet without ſin, is another excellent
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:45718:96"/>way to oblige thoſe that are in authority, to do all they can for us. He that ſhall watch an opportunity to do what may be pleaſing to Rulers, and not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpleaſing to God, will find it one time or other. <hi>Joſeph</hi> and <hi>David</hi> gave great content to thoſe Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces whom they ſerved, and yet maintained a good conſcience, as being careful to do both. <hi>David</hi> ſometimes could pleaſe <hi>Saul,</hi> ſo as no man better, <hi>viz.</hi> by playing upon his Harp in his preſence, whereby it is ſaid that <hi>Saul</hi> was refreſhed, and the evil ſpirit departed from him, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.23. and <hi>Saul</hi> ſaith of him, v. 22. <hi>He hath found favour in my ſight.</hi> Honeſtly to pleaſe is the way to obtain fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, both with God and men, and that may be done, if not at one time, yet at another. <hi>Rebekah</hi> having obſerved her husbands diet, knew how to pleaſe his pallate; and to provide him ſavory meat, ſuch as his Soul loved, and ſuch as paſſed with him for the Veniſon he longed for, though it was no Veniſon: and ſo ſhe got the bleſſing for her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved <hi>Jacob.</hi> Doubtleſs <hi>David</hi> was glad of all opportunities to gratifie <hi>Saul,</hi> by playing on his Harp before him (ſo that <hi>Saul</hi> could not be more glad to hear his muſick) let us in like manner re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce when we can make melody in the ears, and hearts of our Governours, by any thing that we can lawfully do. He is a wiſe ſon that makes a glad Father, and what will not a powerful Father do for that Son that makes him glad?</p>
            <p>Let Rulers have all poſſible aſſurance given them, that the rebuilding of <hi>London</hi> ſhall not tend to their prejudice (as ſome have maliciouſly, and weakly objected) but to their great benefit, and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, that <hi>London</hi> if rebuilt will certainly be theirs, as ſubmiſſe, and loyal, and ready to ſerve them as their hearts can wiſh. Were they not ſo before
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:45718:97"/>the Fire? and why ſhould we not think they will be ſo again? What mutiny and inſurrection againſt the Government hath there been, ever ſince the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn of his Majeſty (that of <hi>Venner,</hi> and his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plices excepted, whoſe number was exceeding ſmall, and deſpicable) from one end of that City to the other?</p>
            <p>Neither hath <hi>London</hi> contented it ſelf with being only peaceable, and free from tumults ſince the Kings reſtauration, but upon all occaſions appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved it ſelf a loyal, and loving City, particularly by their great loans of money, in reference to which, that expreſſion in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.2. may be reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently alluded to, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>their deep poverty hath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded to the riches of their liberality.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But when all this is ſaid, if Londoners know any other thing, or things, whereby they may render thoſe that rule over them, yet more confident and more highly aſſured of their love, and loyalty, than by what they have done already, they are, or might be, let them have the ſecurity, beſides the former; that they may be fully ſatisfied that in building a City for Londoners they build a <hi>London</hi> for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
            <p>It is my humble, and earneſt motion, that all that is lawful and poſſible to be done, to ſecure and fortifie the minds of our Rulers, againſt all ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion, and jealouſie of any the leaſt diſaffection in the people towards them, I ſay that all ſuch things might be done; that they may as willingly intruſt them with a new and famous City (carried on by their utmoſt countenance and aſſiſtance) as they themſelves are willing to be ſo intruſted.</p>
            <p>How do I long to ſee the day, in which Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates and People ſhall love one another, no leſs than indulgent parents, and good children uſe to
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:45718:97"/>do; that Court and City, ſhall ſet themſelves to promote the happineſs each of other, ſhould owe one another nothing but love, ſhould alwayes be paying that debt, and yet confeſſing themſelves to be ſtill in debted as to that.</p>
            <p>Concerning that mutual obligingneſs which was betwixt <hi>Solomon</hi> (the wiſeſt of Kings, yea of men) and his people, we read in <hi>Pſ.</hi> 72. <hi>v.</hi> 12. <hi>He ſhall deliver the needy when he cryeth, the poor alſo and him that hath no helper.</hi> This was ſpoken of <hi>Solomon</hi> in type, but of Chriſt as the antitype, that he ſhould do thus for his people, but then in the 15. verſe, it is ſaid, <hi>To him ſhall be given of the gold of Shebah; prayer alſo ſhall be made for him continually and daily ſhall he be praiſed:</hi> which words expreſs what the people ſhould do for <hi>Solomon,</hi> how they ſhould oblige him, who would be ſo obliging to them. Now what is prophecied as the reſult of <hi>Solomon</hi> and his people, thus vying which ſhould oblige each other moſt; I doubt not to apply to our City of <hi>London,</hi> in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to its great increaſe from its preſent ſmall beginnings, under the incouragements of an obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged magiſtracy: <hi>There ſhall be a handful of corn in the earth upon the top of the mountains</hi> (<hi>London</hi> is now as that handful of corn) <hi>the fruit thereof ſhall ſhake like Lebanon, and they of the City ſhall flouriſh like graſs of the earth. v.</hi> 16.</p>

            <p>A General contentment would cauſe Religion to reflouriſh, and conſequently the City.

            <p>And now my buſineſs is to prove, that an univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal contentment would be much to the furtherance and advancement of Religion; and the want there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of would hinder the growth and increaſe of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, as much as any one thing, and conſequently

Diſcontents are ſome of thoſe thorns which indanger the choaking of all good ſeed. Religion is a ſervice reaſonable, but diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and oppreſſion, do make men mad. Many Suns are wont to go down upon the wrath of diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented perſons, and therefore they muſt needs <hi>give place to the Devil,</hi> Eph. 4.26. and what, mean time, becomes of their Religion.</p>
            <p>Methinks I cannot ſay enough, to make the world ſenſible of that vaſt prejudice which redounds to Religion by the generality of men being diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented, and out of humor, to the end men may labor to prevent, or cure it, both in themſelves and others. The Pſalmiſt ſaith why do the heathen rage? and from ſad experience it may be ſaid, that to make men rage, or outragious, is one of the readieſt wayes to make them heathens. Such as are deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:45718:100"/>diſcontented, uſe not to care either what they ſay, or what they do; no not againſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, witneſs <hi>Achitophel,</hi> no not againſt God, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8.21. Therefore it was that Satan deſired of God, <hi>to touch all that Job had, and</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>he will curſe thee to thy face,</hi> Job. 1.11. <hi>If he curſe thee not to thy face,</hi> it is in the margent, <hi>q. d.</hi> if he do not I am de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, and ſo he was: but knowing the manner of other men, he thought he could not forbear to curſe God, when his affliction was ſo very great. Though one ſort of poor are ſaid to receive the Goſpel (that is more generally than others;) yet thoſe that are poor unto beggery, pincht with cold, and hunger, are too well known to be generally as vile as any ſort of men, and as void of the leaſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of Religion (which made <hi>Agar</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precate poverty) and probable it is, that their being greatly male content may be the principal reaſon.</p>
            <p>It cannot be denied but that we ought to be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered by miſeries, as well as by mercies, <hi>and to learn obedience by the things which we ſuffer</hi> and it is often ſo that when the troubles of men are but mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate they do them good, and not hurt; but when men are whipt with Scorpions, when their puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are greater than they can bear, then corrupt nature diſcovers its ſelf, as naturaliſts ſay in another ſenſe, <hi>Vexata natura prodit ſeipſam.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I could never yet ſee that deep melancholy, and high diſcontent was a proper ſoil for Religion to thrive in, but rather the quite contrary. <hi>Saul</hi> when at his wits ends, betook himſelf to the witch of <hi>Endor,</hi> and too many are of his mind that ſaid, <hi>Flectere ſi nequeo ſuperos Acheronta movebo.</hi> They will addreſs to Hell, if they cannot prevail with Heaven. They that look upon their condition to be a kind
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:45718:100"/>of Hell upon Earth, will ſcarce refrain blaſpheming, as they do that are in Hell. A general diſcontent is an axe la<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d to the root of Religion. What Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on can there be, where there is no love? what love can there be to God, or men, when there is no contentment with the providence of the one, or practiſes of the other? Gods diſpenſations, and mens dealings, are ſo interwoven, that men are ſeldom angry with the latter, but they are ſo with the former, becauſe the hand of divine providence is in all the dealings of men (though in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as to be no whit acceſſary to the unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of any of them.) How oft is God leſs loved than otherwiſe he would be for mens ſake, and for the ſake of thoſe miſactings, whereby they become hated? and all becauſe his providence is known to concur (but in a moſt juſtifiable way) with all the proceedings of men.</p>
            <p>Wizards, Witches, and Devils, ſhall be the laſt inſtances, I will now produce of the ſad fruits of prevailing diſcontent, as to the extirpating of all Religion. Devils we juſtly account the worſt of all creatures, Wizards and Witches the worſt, and fartheſt from Religion of any ſort of men and women; now Wizards and Witches are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly deemed the moſt diſcontented parcel of mankind, as well as the worſt; and Devils which are ſomething worſe than Witches themſelves, yet more diſcontented than they.</p>
            <p>How do I therefore long for Religion ſake to ſee an end of Diſcontents, that ſome men would take care to give leſs offence, and others would take no more than becomes them. Methinks that ſame is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

All this while it muſt be ill with the heart of <hi>England</hi> (and what is the heart and Soul of a Nation, but the Religion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of?) was ever man in a feaver and his heart uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, or not diſordered thereby, as much or more than any other part?</p>
            <p>Now for a <hi>David</hi> with his Harp, to lay the evil ſpirit of diſcontent, now for ſome muſical harmony (though made up of diſcords, to cure the venemous bitings of that ſtrange <hi>Tarantula</hi> (diſcontent I mean) which makes men moan, and wail, and cry out, of which diſeaſe nothing will cure men, but that which will make them leap and dance, (rejoyce I mean) as it is in the cure of thoſe that are bitten by a true <hi>Tarantula.</hi> When that cure ſhall be wrought, then may we hope Religion will <hi>flouriſh as the Palm-tree, and grow as the Cedars in Lebanon,</hi> and <hi>London</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with it.</p>

            <p>IF God continue peace, we may have more Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laces within our walls, and proſperity within our Pallaces. But if peace diſcontinue ſo is our City like to do: never had we more need of peace both at home and abroad, then now; that we have a City to build.

            <p>A relapſe into war (which would be worſe then the firſt diſeaſe) would put us upon making bullets inſtead of bricks, tents inſtead of houſes, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of hiring artificers, to preſs Souldiers.</p>

                  <hi>That leſſening the price of Coals would incourage building.</hi>
               </p>
            </argument>
            <p>I Cannot charge them that trade in Coals with holding up the price, higher than they needs muſt, and contriving wayes and methods to make them dear, but they cannot be ignorant that ſome do ſo charge them, and if it be ſo, indeed they are much to blame, at ſuch a time as this eſpecially; and as the latine proverb is <hi>nigro carbone digni.</hi> To deny us coals at this juncture, (and to make them over-dear is half a denial of them) is in effect to withold ſtraw from them that ſhould make brick.</p>
            <p>It is fit that when war ceaſeth, we ſhould taſt the fruits of peace, (as particularly in the cheapneſs of ſo neceſſary a commodity, as Coals are) elſe how ſhould we be thankful for it? the community ought not to be impoveriſhed, that a few men may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched.</p>
            <pb n="167" facs="tcp:45718:102"/>
            <p>If care be taken (as I hope there will) that the quantities of Coals imported, ſhould be as much greater now than formerly, as is the occaſion we have for them, more than it had wont to be, that our ſtore may rather exceed than fall ſhort, plenty will bring down the price; and yet I wiſh it not ſo low neither, but that they who deal in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity may live by it. Give me leave to ſay, that men in ſubordinate authority, have been more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely reflected upon than I ſhall venture to tell, as void of care and prudence, or both, in not prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that dearth of coals, which befel us the laſt year, it being then the common cry, that the nation could almoſt as well ſubſiſt without corn, as with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out coals.

            <p>If Coals be dear, bricks cannot be cheap, neither will they be good (that is well-burnt) but if coals be cheap, bricks will not be dear; neither are they like to be bad.

               </p>
            </argument>
            <p>IT goes to my heart to think, how people are tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, (or torment themſelves) with endleſs fears, and jealouſies. They are ever and anon in ſuch frights, <hi>as if Hanibal were at the gates.</hi> How do they ſtart like melancoly people out of their ſleeps, ſcared with ſad dreams? Damps ariſe upon men (as they are ſaid to do upon thoſe that work in coal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines.</p>
            <p>I would be no fomenter of ſuch fears, but am thought rather too ſanguine, too credulous of good news, and ſcarce in the number of thoſe wiſe men, of whom <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>that they foreſee the evil and hide themſelves.</hi> I had rather (as is ſaid of <hi>Abraham</hi>) <hi>in hope believe againſt hope,</hi> than be to ſuſpicious, at leaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe than to make others ſo.</p>
            <p>It may be ſome envious men have ſowed theſe tares, I mean ſome that envy, and malign the building of the City, and do deſire to obſtruct it by making people afraid. For men are ſo poſſeſſed (I know not by whom) <hi>(my Soul enter not thou into their ſecrets)</hi> that they cry out: we ſhall ere long be invaded by the French, &amp; other while we ſhall be maſſacred by the help of thoſe diſaffected forreig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners which (ſay they) do ſwarm amongſt us, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther while they cry we ſhall be burnt again: what pannick fears are theſe?</p>
            <pb n="169" facs="tcp:45718:103"/>
            <p>I wiſh we could out the head of this <hi>Nilus,</hi> thoſe fears I mean which like another <hi>Nilus</hi> overflow the land, but whence they ſpring I know not: whether the cauſe be that people are hardly come to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, ſince the great and dreadful fire, or that our great ſurpriſe at <hi>Chattam,</hi> hath brought theſe fears upon men; or that thoſe many leſſer fires, which have hapned ſince the great one, have produced a habit of fear, or all of theſe together, or whither (as I ſaid at firſt) ſome do make it their buſineſs to terrifie <hi>Londoners,</hi> that they may have no heart to build. It is hard to ſay which of theſe are the true cauſe. But that which I mentioned laſt was the courſe which the enemies of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> took to hinder the building thereof, <hi>Neh.</hi> 6.9. <hi>They all made us afraid ſaying, their hand ſhall be weakned from the work that it be not done,</hi> and v. 29. <hi>Tobiah ſent let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to put me in fear.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But let the cauſe be what it will, it is fit the cure ſhould be thought of: For fears and jealouſies have been of pernicious conſequence, and may be ſo again. Parents cannot indure to have their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren frighted, leſt it bring them to convulſions, or make ſots of them. None ſo cruel as cowards, or frighted perſons, becauſe they are moſt impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent till they have made ſure of their enemies, <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperation turns to valour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It hath always been held good policy to ſecure a people againſt fears and jealouſies, though they were ſuch as did ariſe from their own miſtakes, and weakneſs. <hi>Achitophel</hi> taught <hi>Abſalom</hi> to make the people ſure of him, that he never would or could be reconciled to his Father <hi>David,</hi> and ſo leave them in the lurch, by counſelling him to lye with his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Concubines, in the ſight of the people, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.20.</p>
            <pb n="170" facs="tcp:45718:104"/>
            <p>Was it not a meer jealouſie and miſapprehenſion which the Jews had entertained concerning <hi>Paul? viz. As if he taught the Jews which were amongſt the Gentiles to forſake Moſes, ſaying that they ought not to circumciſe their children, neither to walk after the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes,</hi> Acts. 21.21. yet <hi>Paul</hi> was adviſed to take it off (and did v. 26) <hi>We have four men which have a vow on them.

God himſelf (ſuch is his condeſcenſion to this kind of weakneſs in men) hath provided all that may he againſt thoſe groundleſs fears, and jealouſies, as touching himſelf, and the ſatisfying of his promiſe (which is impoſſible for him to do) which our miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving hearts might expoſe us to. And therefore it is that he hath confirmed his promiſe with an oath, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.18. <hi>God willing more abundantly (it was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ex abundanti for him ſo to do) to ſhew the immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of his counſel, confirmed it by an oath,</hi> v. 19. <hi>That by two immutable things we might have ſtrong conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the great difficulty will be, to ſhew how and by what means the fears, and Jealouſies of men (thoſe terrible names ſounding like <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gog</hi>) may be prevented or extirpated.</p>
            <p>To indeavour to tye the tongues of men, that whatſoever they think, they ſhould ſay nothing, would be a fruitleſs attempt, <hi>for out of the abundance of mens hearts their mouthes will ſpeak.</hi> That were at moſt but like the mowing of weeds, without pluck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them up by the roots, which weeds would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly ſpring again, faſter than ever they did before.</p>
            <p>To tell men they have had many falſe alarms will
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:45718:104"/>not ſatisfie them neither, for ſo ſouldiers uſe to ſerve their enemies before they fall upon them in good earneſt; and ſo the ſheep in the fable heard it often ſaid that the Wolf was coming, when he was not: but yet he came at laſt when he was not lookt for. Some more effectual remedy muſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be thought of, againſt the dangerous, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious diſeaſe of fears, and Jealouſies, than were either of the two former.</p>
            <p>Were I worthy to caſt in a mite of advice in ſo arduous a caſe (which had more need of <hi>a Prieſt to ſtand up with Urim and Thummim</hi> to direct in it) I would ſay as followeth.</p>
            <p>One way to take of fears and jealouſies, would be by manifeſting an univerſal, and impartial love to all ſober, peaceable and deſerving perſons, even from <hi>Dan to Beerſheba</hi> without reſpect of perſons, or parties, upon any other conſiderations. It is as natural for men to fear thoſe that they think do hate them, as it is to hate thoſe they are afraid of. If one part of a nation be Archers armed with bows and arrows, and another look upon it ſelf as not beloved, and therefore aimed at, ſo long fears and jealouſies will continue; whereas on the other hand we uſe to ſay, we could put our lives into their hands of whom we are confident that they do truly love us.</p>
            <p>If perſons who are both in, and under authority, (as was the Centurion we read of) (who are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the eyes and hands of Princes) would pleaſe to manifeſt a conſtant care, and zeal for the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick good, ſuffering nothing to be wanting on their part, that might conduce to publick ſafety, giving no advantage to forreign or inteſtine ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, by their cowardize, covetouſneſs or careleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, committing no groſs miſcarriages and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſights,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:45718:105"/>(like careleſs ſervants that leave their maſters doors wide open in the night time, that who will may come in and ſteal, if they will ſee that all be ſafely bolted and barred from time to time) I ſay if they pleaſe to do ſo, by that means for one; they may diſperſe fears and jealouſies, as the Sun doth ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter miſts. <hi>Timothy</hi> is much commended <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.20. <hi>For that he did naturally care for the ſtate of others,</hi> and they that ſhall do ſo, and be known ſo to do, will never be ſuſpected, they will adde to the hope and confidence of a nation, but never to their fears and jealouſies.</p>
            <p>There is no better prevention, or cure of fears, and Jealouſies, than to win the hearts love, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of a people, otherwiſe ſubject thereunto: men are as unapt to fear thoſe whom they greatly love, as they are to love thoſe whom they are great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly afraid of: love is fearful of nothing but to offend, <hi>Perfect love caſteth out fear, viz.</hi> All that fear which hath torment accompanying it; and needs it muſt do ſo, becauſe it is founded in and upon the aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of their love, whom we ſo love. The Apoſtle ſaith of charity, or love, that <hi>it is not eaſily provoked, that it thinketh no evil, rejoyceth not in iniquity but in the truth, believeth all things, hopeth all things,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. Thoſe very things that bring, or ſhall bring on love, will carry off fears, and jealouſies.</p>
            <p>One good way to be truſted by others, is to truſt others, ſo far as in reaſon we may, Jealouſies beget Jealouſies, and ſome men will not, or cannot truſt, becauſe they are not truſted, as far as they think they might or deſerve to be. It is commonly found, that men are jealous of thoſe that are jealous of them, for men are jealous of thoſe that they believe do not love them, and they do not believe they can love them, who are much jealous of them. For
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:45718:105"/>perfect fear will caſt out love, as perfect love doth fear. On the other hand confidence begets confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence: it is an uſual argumentation amongſt men, why ſhould not we put confidence in ſuch and ſuch, as well as they put confidence in us? as if it were a piece of gratitude, and but juſtice to truſt thoſe that truſt us. Whereas on the other hand, men that will take no aſſurance from others, but what is more than enough, or than they can give; will be able to give no aſſurance to others that will be taken, and ſo jealouſies will be endleſly propagated by way of retaliation.</p>
            <p>As good a receipt as any of the former for the cure of fears and jealouſies is this, <hi>viz.</hi> that perſons who have the unhappineſs to be generally ſuſpected, and ill beloved, (though poſſibly they may not deſerve it) ſhould have as little of the ſafety, and welfare of a nation committed to them as can well be, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as the ſpirit of jealouſie, preſently comes upon people, when thoſe whom they are greatly prejudiced againſt (as being of a contrary religion, or otherwiſe) are choſen to places of eminency, either military or civil.

            <p>Laſtly, If the heats and indiſcretions of ſome men were lookt after, who ſometimes ſeem to ſymbolize with Papiſts in their peculiar doctrines, and then the people by ſuch preaching alarm'd, cry out with a loud voice <hi>Venient Romani,</hi> and who other whiles exaſperate their hearers with bitter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vectives, putting them thereby into an expectation of nothing but trouble, and perſecution to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Certain it is, that Papiſts at this day are a very center of jealouſie, in and upon whom the fears of all Engliſh Proteſtants, of what perſwaſion ſoever, do meet: Is it becauſe the bloud that was ſhed in the <hi>Marian</hi> daies doth ſtill cry aloud in the ears of men as well as of Heaven? or is it becauſe the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſion attempted upon <hi>England</hi> in Eighty Eight is not yet forgotten? or is it becauſe the <hi>Pariſian</hi> Maſſacre will not out of mens minds? or is it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the moſt helliſh Powder Plot (upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt of which we celebrate each fifth of <hi>Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi>) doth ſtill ſtick in mens ſtomacks? or is it long of that moſt devilliſh Tragedy which was act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Papiſts in <hi>Ireland</hi> upon the Innocent Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, within leſs than thirty years paſt, cauſing the ſtreets to ſwim with their bloud? or is it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>London</hi> was lately ſo ſuddenly and ſtrangely burnt, and Papiſts known to inſult and triumph when it was done, beſides other ſuſpitious paſſages of theirs relating thereunto, as namely their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions concerning it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or is it all of theſe put together that do make Papiſts ſo formidable to Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants in <hi>England?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some rather than be thought to fear where no fear is, would be ready to give many more reaſons of the fear that is in them, to every one that ſhould ask them why they are ſo much afraid of Papiſts. Firſt, their hatred to Proteſtants by the forementi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned inſtances appeareth to be great, and implaca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; then they would tell you, that many Families of that Religion in <hi>England</hi> are very conſiderable for their eſtates, parts, and otherwiſe. Nextly, that they are great pretenders unto having high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly merited (as from God, ſo from men) above others, if not to works of Supererrogation, which is as if they challenged it as their due to be upper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt.
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:45718:107"/>How politick, how vigilant, and how reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs a people they are, all men know, how they compaſs Sea and Land to carry on their deſigns! The men of their Religion ſeem to have a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar ſpite at <hi>England,</hi> and an ambition to ſubdue it to themſelves, rather than any other Nation; as he ſaid, <hi>Fight neither againſt great nor ſmall, but, &amp;c.</hi> ſo they ſeem to ſay, but againſt <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We ſhould not fear them (ſay they) but that we know what Religion <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> are of, and can have no aſſurance that they will not, one time or other, crave aid (at leaſtwiſe of ſo near a Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour as one of them is) rather than fail of their deſigns: What ſhould hinder them from ſo doing, who profeſs to the world that they do owe more homage to a forreign Prince (<hi>viz.</hi> the Pope) than to their own, and that the Pope is Supreme Head over all temporal Princes, and conſequently can ſuperſede the Laws of any other Prince, and give away their Crowns and Scepters when and to whom he pleaſeth? If then the Pope ſhall command them to joyn with, or invite in a Forreign Prince againſt their own Sovereign, according to that principle, it is but their duty to do it. Now who can but fear a people of ſo deſperate, ſubverting principles?</p>
            <p>Be ſecure of Papiſts (ſay ſome) we never can, for no cords can be thought of wherewith to bind them faſt: Their oaths are not to be regarded, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it is their principle, that <hi>no faith is to be kept with Hereticks,</hi> and ſuch they count Proteſtants. They are ſo great aſſertors of the doctrine of Equivocation, and ſo great Maſters in the practiſe thereof, that give them what oath you will, they make what they pleaſe of it in their mental reſervations, they put in and put out what they liſt, and interpret every thing to their own ſenſe, and having ſo done, what
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:45718:107"/>is any body the nearer (<hi>viz.</hi> to ſafety and ſecurity) for any oath they take? Come the worſt to the worſt they hold, that the Pope hath a power of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſing with oaths, either that men may take thoſe oaths which before-hand they reſolve not to keep, at leaſtwiſe that he can pardon them (and will do it) if they break the oaths that they have taken.</p>
            <p>It were endleſs to rehearſe all the reaſons men give why they are afraid of the Popiſh party: who knows not (ſay they) that all things are lawful in their account, which make for the intereſt and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion of holy Church (as they call it?) the ſtamp of ſo good an intention put upon the worſt of actions, be it lying, perjury, murther, rebellion, devaſtation of whole Countries, is (according to them) able to make what had otherwiſe been dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, to become meritorious: He that ſhall aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaſſinate a King in zeal for their Religion, may be canonized for a Saint. O Religion, ever to be dreaded by thoſe that are not of it, as being reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to propagate it ſelf every where, both by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret plots, and open violence, by fire and ſword, by fraud and force, <hi>per fas &amp; nefas:</hi> By hook and by crook (as they ſay) as if none were worthy to live but they that would imbrace a Religion ſo falſe and ridiculous (ſo far as it is it ſelf) as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be more.</p>
            <p>Methinks I am tired with hearing ſo many rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons alledged for one and the ſame thing, a thing ſo generally believed, <hi>viz.</hi> that there is juſt ground to be afraid of Papiſts, and of their deſigns, but would I liſten to more, ſome would further tell me, that the great Agitators for Popery, <hi>Jeſuites,</hi> and ſuch like, do inſinuate themſelves into all parts of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendome; firſt trouble the waters of every State, and then fiſh in them, make Proſelites up and
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:45718:108"/>down, undermine the Councels of Proteſtant Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that thoſe Pioneers are alwayes working under ground, and indanger all Kingdoms where they come: Alſo, that there are multitudes of them here, and there, in ſeveral diſguizes, the effects of whoſe pernicious attempts we may yearly, if not daily expect.</p>
            <p>That Papiſts are ſtill too hard for thoſe ſevere Laws that are in being againſt them, ſo that they (or moſt of them) come not under the laſh thereof, from moneth to moneth, and year to year, whilſt the Laws made againſt others do find them out con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually, and puniſh their ſmaller tranſgreſſions; I ſay, that they eſcape the <hi>Ordeal</hi> of Laws, whilſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ever and anon do burn their feet upon the hot plow-ſhares which are laid for them, doth much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the fears of men concerning them.</p>
            <p>Now they that have a fear and dread of Papiſts upon them, having all this to ſay, (and yet having not ſaid all) do think it hard meaſure to be taxed with childiſhneſs, cowardize, and effeminacy, for entertaining a jealouſie of Popiſh deſigns, and cannot be otherwiſe perſwaded by any verbal argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>Nevertheleſs, I am deceived if there be not a way to relieve Proteſtants againſt all their fears of Papiſts, and yet not to deprive Papiſts either of their lives, or eſtates, or liberties, or Native Soil, or any thing elſe which by Law or birth they have a right to, nor yet alwayes, and in all caſes, to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute upon all, and every of them, the full rigour of thoſe Laws which are at this day in force againſt them.</p>
            <p>Who but themſelves will be offended, if it be in the firſt place propounded, that the Popiſh party throughout <hi>England</hi> ſhould be generally diſarmed?
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:45718:108"/>that is, deprived of all weapons, horſes, arms, am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which they have, or may have by them, more than is juſt ſufficient for the defence of their reſpective families, againſt the breaking in of Thieves and Robbers. A Maſſacre committed by Proteſtants upon Papiſts was never heard of, and therefore they need not fear it, nor can reaſonably deſire to abound with arms, in order to the preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it: If men have arms enough for their own ſecurity, what ſhould they do with more to ſcare, if not indanger others? How greatly would the fears of men be allayed, if but that one thing were done? <hi>Ireland</hi> that <hi>Aceldama, that field of bloud,</hi> can tell us how unfit Papiſts are to be intruſted with arms.</p>
            <p>I wiſh if thoſe rumors be falſe, that great and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſual numbers of forreign Papiſts have lately come for <hi>England,</hi> I ſay if they be falſe, that the people might be generally aſſured and convinced they are ſo; but if they be true, (which is more than I can ſay they are) that ſome due bounds may be ſet to ſo raging a Sea, leaſt a deluge of fears and ſuſp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, if not of miſery and deſtruction alſo, ſhould from thence overwhelm us.</p>
            <p>It hath been complained of in and to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſince <hi>London</hi> was in the duſt, that many Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts in ſeveral parts of <hi>England</hi> have behaved them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves very inſolently (as one of their eloquent mouths hath told us in a Speech of his extant in print) that certainly would and did ſtrike terrour into the people; nor can thoſe terrours be taken off, unleſs that inſolency of theirs be corrected, for which there need no better curb and cure, than the ſtrict execution of the ſevereſt Laws that are in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt men of that Religion, I do not mean, or wiſh upon all of them (for I underſtand not the
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:45718:109"/>juſtice of puniſhing all that are of ſuch a way for the faults that are committed but by ſome of them) but upon as many as have, or ſhall be found guilty of ſuch amuſing inſolency, either in words or deeds: It is fit ſome Corroſive ſhould be applied to ſuch proud fleſh, but not laid upon that fleſh which is not proud, though of the ſame body: The <hi>ſummum jus,</hi> or utmoſt rigour of the Laws made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Papiſts, would be no injury to them that ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie others by their inſolency, what ever it might be to the reſt, as in ſome caſes it would not be harſh to take the full forfeiture of a Bond, though it would be ſo in ſome others. If the <hi>Hugonites</hi> in <hi>France</hi> ſhould behave themſelves inſolently (which they never dare to do, being not of the Religion of the Country) we know what would follow. A re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint upon the inſolencies of Papiſts, would be no ſmall reſtraint upon the fears of Proteſtants.</p>
            <p>I wiſh as little power as may be in the hands of Papiſts, for that experience tells us, if perſons ſo accounted (though not certainly known to be ſuch) be choſen to any place or places of conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able truſt, it preſently openeth the peoples mouths, and fills them as full of fears as they can hold. Power is a kind of armour, and men may be armed with power as formidably, as with iron weapons. We read of certain beaſts, Dan. 7.12. <hi>They had their dominion taken away, yet their lives were prolong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi> There is not a quiet Papiſt in <hi>England,</hi> but I wiſh his life might be ſpared, yea, and his lawful way of livelihood; that if a man of an eſtate, he might enjoy it, his Religion notwithſtanding, if a Tradeſman, he might be free to buy, and ſell, and merchandize, as well as other men; and if he may do ſo, to be deprived or debarred of power and arms, will be but an eaſie ſuffering (if it be any at
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:45718:109"/>all) and I am ſure much more for a publick good, men to their private damage: no reaſon they ſhould be elected to power, who would be an incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to evil doers, and a terror to them that do <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

One I have heard of (a perſon of worth and learning far above the rate of his years) who was put upon this work by ſome in great authority, and hath diſcharged it excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently well, and brought forth an Elephant (for ſo
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:45718:110"/>I call his book for the ſize of it) in leſs than halfe the time that Elephants are ſaid to go with their young. There are alſo two other pregnant Divines (no old men neither) who have each of them given us an iliad in a nutſhel, a maſs of Divinity and reaſon againſt popiſh doctrines within a ſmall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs, who as I am told have from perſons of emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency received many thanks for the ſame, and very good incouragement. Were there many more that could come up to the firſt three, as champions againſt popery, and were they in all parts of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> put upon it and quickned, we might hope that popery would dwindle amongſt us every day till at laſt it come to nothing.</p>
            <p>Whoſoever ſhall ſet himſelf to oppoſe the growth and ſpreading of popery in <hi>England,</hi> will much promote this deſign, by ſuppreſſing, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting all ſuch books in our native tongue, as have lately come forth, or are coming forth in favour of that Religion. Thoſe of more ancient date are ſo much diſperſed already, that there can be no recall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, and beſides that, men will hardly read them more than they have done, whereas a new book for the novelty ſake, and in expectation of ſome new thing that hath not been ſaid before, will have many readers. Popiſh arguments are not ſo weighty but that we dare let ſchollars peruſe them, and therefore I have ſaid nothing of the ſuppreſſion of thoſe popiſh books which are in the latine tongue, but only in the Engliſh, leſt comon, and ignorant people ſhould thereby be ſeduced. Now Papiſts of all men ought not to quarrel with us, if we deny the common people the uſe of their books, in their mother tongue, as being unſafe for them, ſith they withhold the book of God, the holy ſcriptures from the Laity under pretence of their being in danger
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:45718:110"/>to wreſt the ſame to their own deſtruction. If truth can hurt men what will not errour do? A heedful ſuppreſſion of all Novel Engliſh popiſh books, would be greatly to the ſuppreſſion of all popular fears, as with reſpect to Papiſts.</p>
            <p>We have ſevere Laws (if I miſtake not) againſt thoſe perſons <hi>who compaſs ſea and land to make</hi> people <hi>Proſelytes</hi> to the Romiſh religion, <hi>making them</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by <hi>two-fold more the children of hell than themſelves,</hi> at leaſtwiſe in this reſpect, that they perſwade them to believe thoſe groſs errours, which they have more wit than to believe themſelves, ſo binding heavy burthens upon others which they themſelves will not touch with the leaſt of their fingers. I think the law is wont to accuſe: and indict them, as for ſeducing the Kings Subjects from their Allegiance, which to do is a great crime, but do they not alſo ſeduce men from their Allegiance to the King of Kings? Theſe are a ſeed of evil doers, and muſt be look't a ter: Ants do bite the corn which they carry to their mole-hils to the end it may not ſprout again, ſo far forth, I wiſh them bitten. It is too much that they take upon them to make a God or Idol of Wafers, let them not make fools, or which is worſe, Idolaters of men. Let them not by their meats (or poiſons rather) deſtroy thoſe for whom Chriſt died. As long as Papiſts have liberty for themſelves, and their families, they have little rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to complain, if they have no liberty to make other families ſuch as themſelves. If ſeducing Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits be narrowly watcht and puniſhed, both the fear of Papiſts, and popery it ſelf will be much di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhed.</p>
            <p>What a buzzing is there in the ears of people concerning ſome preachers (no profeſſed Papiſts neither) who ſeem to affect the language of <hi>Aſhdod,</hi>
               <pb n="184" facs="tcp:45718:111"/>and to the great amuſement of people, make their pulpits eccno to <hi>Rome</hi> ever and anon. Who ſpeak ſometimes at ſuch a rate, as if they had a Pope in their belly, or had a mind to appear as popiſhly affected as they durſt. The laſhers out of popery, are the men who have all along fomented the Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies of the people, and made them fear they ſhould be over-run with Papiſts, as the ſluggards ground is ſaid to be with weeds. If ſuch men were taught either to preach more honeſtly and ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxly, or elſe for ever hereafter made to hold their peace, the juſtice done them might greatly abate the peoples fears, as their hetorodoximony have inflamed them.</p>
            <p>Whilſt Papiſts play leaſt in ſight, I mean whilſt the exerciſe of their Religion is very obſcure and private, ſo long that proverb is made good <hi>What the eye ſeeth not the heart rueth not,</hi> but if it ſhould chance to ſhew its head in publick; if it came forth like a bridegroom, out of his chamber deckt and trimmed, to take the eyes of its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders, if it come forth with its luſcious muſick, tempting the people to dance after it; then will the mouths of mens fears, and complaints alſo, be wide opened, then will they ſuſpect it will bear down all before it. Sith then their Religion is impure, and the people extremely jealous of them, and it, let them with the <hi>Adulterer ſeek the twilight, yea the black and dark night.</hi> Let them ſteal their wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters (if they will have any) and eat their bread in ſecreſie, ſo it may be as ſweet to them, and not ſo bitter, and vexatious to others; ſo ſhall they not need to fear others, neither will others be afraid of them.</p>

               <p> 
                  <hi>That to be thankful to God, and men, for the good be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings of a new City, is one good way to perfect it.</hi>
               </p>
            </argument>
            <p>WE are doubly indebted for that part and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of another <hi>London,</hi> be it a tenth, or whatſoever it is, which we ſee already: Firſt to the great God, of whom it is ſaid <hi>Pſ.</hi> 127.1. <hi>Except the Lord build the houſe they labour in vain that build it.</hi> Nextly, and ſubordinately, to men for whatſoever they have contributed thereunto, by their advice, authority, bounty, induſtry, or otherwiſe; and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly for that excellent, and prudent Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, which was quickly made in the caſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides an additional Bill for that purpoſe, which had paſſed the honourable Houſe of Commons, and ſeemed to meet with no obſtruction in the honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Houſe of Lords, but want of time to paſs it: and which we doubt not, when the two houſes ſhall come together again, will be readily agreed to, and made into an Act.</p>
            <p>How noble a precedent of thankfulneſs for a good beginning (and no more) is that we read of, <hi>Ezra</hi> 3.10. <hi>And when the builders laid the foundation of the Temple of the Lord, they ſet the Prieſts and the Levites to praiſe the Lord,</hi> v. 11. <hi>And all the people ſhouted with a great ſhout, when they praiſed the Lord becauſe the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the houſe of the Lord was laid.</hi> Though the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient men who had ſeen the firſt, did weep at the ſame time with a loud voice (becauſe the latter was not to be compared with the former;) yet the reſt of the people gave thanks, and ſhouted for joy. And certainly they took a right courſe to have ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Temple brought to perfection, in being ſo
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:45718:112"/>thankful for it, whilſt it was yet but imperfect. They that will ſee a mercy finiſhed before they give thanks for it, reſolve to truſt God no further man they can ſee him.</p>
            <p>The ſacrifice of praiſe (whereby God is glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) is not to be defer'd till ſuch time as the work of mercy hath brought forth, but is to be offered, ſo ſoon as there is but a conception, or at leaſtwiſe, any life and motion in it; to diſcover that it hath conceived. As the hearty ſucking of a child brings down more milk into thoſe breaſts in which there was but little at the firſt: ſo a thankful heart brings down more, and more mercy, and fills thoſe breaſts more full, which by our daily receivings we are as it were emptying. What Chriſt ſaid to <hi>Nathaniel</hi> in reference to his believing, <hi>John</hi> 1.50. <hi>Becauſe I ſaid I ſaw thee under the figtree believeſt thou? thou ſhalt ſee greater things than theſe,</hi> may be applied to thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving; If for a little mercy we have received al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, we can be daily thankful, we ſhall be ſure of more. We ſhould be thankful for the leaſt of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, for that we our ſelves are leſs than the leaſt.</p>
            <p>What better copy can we write after than that of <hi>Ezra</hi> (that holy ſcribe?) <hi>Ezra</hi> 9.8. <hi>And now for a little ſpace grace hath been ſhewn from the Lord to leave us a remnant to eſcape, and to give us a nail in his holy place; that our God my lighten our eyes</hi> (ſo <hi>Jonathans</hi> were with a little honey) <hi>and give us a little reviving in our bondage.</hi> You ſee he was thankful for a rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, for a nail, for a little reviving, and God gave more afterwards. The ſeed of mercy always pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpereth when it lights upon the valley of an humble heart, and is ſoakt with the warm ſhowrs of affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate thankſgivings. So as the great God could have hindred the work we are now in hand with, either by invading us with the Plague, or plagueing
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:45718:113"/>us with an invaſion, or otherwiſe, not one houſe might have been built at this day, of all that were burnt, nor ſo much as one foundation laid, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as now (thanks be to God) ſome hundreds of hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes are already finiſhed: (ſeveral of them more ſtately than before) ſo that now we may allude to what the Pſalmiſt ſpeaketh, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 48.12, 13. <hi>Walk about Zion and go round about her: tell the towers there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, mark ye well her bulwarks, conſider her pallaces, that ye may tell it to the generation following.</hi> So may I ſay, walk now about <hi>London,</hi> mark yee well her palla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, &amp;c. that yee may tell the generation to come, how many goodly buildings were in <hi>London,</hi> within leſs than two years, after the greateſt part of it was burnt to the ground. This is the Lords doing and ſhould be marvellous in our eyes.</p>
            <p>Have not men, as inſtruments, contributed ſomething (and that conſiderable) towards the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>building of the City? (ſuch I mean as had no houſes there of their own to build) and ought they not to be thankfully acknowledged for what they have done? I doubt not but many had a hand in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned Act that had no private concern in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.</hi> So to eye men as to overlook God is the greater fault of the two, but to overlook men when, and wherein they deſerve to be thankfully eyed is likewiſe a fault. <hi>Ezra</hi> hath ſet us a good pattern <hi>Ezra</hi> 7.27. <hi>Bleſſed be the Lord God which hath put ſuch a thing as this in the Kings heart, to beautifie the houſe of the Lord,</hi> v. 28. <hi>And hath extended mercy to me before the King and his counſellors, and before all the Kings mighty Princes, &amp;c.</hi> Here, though the chief honour, and praiſe, was aſcribed to God, yet the King, and his Counſellors, and Princes, were owned alſo. The King is ſaid to have beautified the houſe of God, though God to have put it into his heart ſo to do.</p>
            <pb n="189" facs="tcp:45718:113"/>
            <p>Whenſoever favours are received, be they great or ſmall, thanks becomes a debt, and it is but juſt to pay it. How ſhould they look to proſper who can pay what they owe and will not? and when it is but thanks that is owing, or expected, who cannot pay it? It is a perverſe thing to withhold thanks from them that have deſerved at our hands; out of a conce it they might have deſerved more. They that do for us more than they might have done (be it more or leſs) have earned our thanks, and more it is like they will do, if they find us thankful. Some will ſcatter their bread upon the waters by way of trial, whether they ſhall find it again, I mean they ſhew leſſer kindneſſes at the firſt, to ſee if they ſhall find men thankful, and when they have found them ſo, they open the hands of their bounty much more wide, and their latter favours are ſuch as ſpeak the former, to have bin but a kind of ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt. It is like that Leaper who alone of all the ten that were cured, did return to give thanks; had ſome favour above all the reſt added to his cure, it being uſual with God to thank men (I mean to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward them) for their thanks. And who knows but that our Rulers may have farther intentions of kindneſs towards the poor City, exceeding all that they have done for it already (I had almoſt ſaid as the laſt cloud which <hi>Elijah</hi> ſaw did exceed the firſt, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 18. if ſuch a thing were poſſible) if they ſhall but experiment that they are owned, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged (as I hope they will be) in, and for what they have done already. <hi>Tertullus</hi> that great orator ſpoken of <hi>Acts.</hi> 24. may inform us of the beſt rhetorick wherewith to prevail for future kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, who being about to court <hi>Felix,</hi> to be his friend againſt <hi>Paul,</hi> beſpake him as followeth, <hi>v.</hi> 2, 3. <hi>Seeing that by thee we injoy great quietneſs, and that

And if by prayer in every thing, then doubtleſs by faſting alſo, in things of greater weight, and moment: ought our requeſts to be made known.

               <hi>Satan</hi> is the great obſtructer of every good work 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.18. <hi>We would have come unto you (even I Paul) once and again, but Satan hindred us.</hi> Never had that fowl fiend a greater mind to obſtruct the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of any City in the world (<hi>Jeruſalem</hi> only except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) than I believe he hath to obſtruct the building of <hi>London.</hi> How ſhall we caſt him out but by prayer and faſting? Six other evil Spirits there are (if I may not call them Devils) which do vehemently oppoſe the rebuilding of <hi>London,</hi> and muſt be caſt out by the means forementioned.

               <pb n="191" facs="tcp:45718:114"/>4.10. <hi>And Judah ſaid, the ſtrength of the bearers <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

And our adverſaries ſaid, they ſhall not know, neither ſee, till we come in the widſt amongſt them, and ſlay them, and cauſe the work to ceaſe,</hi> v. 11. This one ſpirit ſhould it ſo rage and domineer, as God might ſuffer it to do, might ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly prevent the building of <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But what think you of the Spirit of Envy, and malice, is not that as bad? That Spirit oppoſed the building of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and ſo it will of <hi>London</hi> ſo far as it can, or dare. <hi>Nehemiah</hi> 2.10. <hi>When San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

            </p>
            <p>Another evil Spirit, which doth, or may hinder the building of <hi>London,</hi> is that of Jealouſie, and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicion, not only in, but of, and concerning that City. This <hi>Sanballat</hi> made great uſe of to hinder the building of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> Nehem. 6.6. <hi>It is reported among the heathens (ſaid he) that thou and the Jews think to rebel, for which cauſe thou buildeſt the wall that thou mayeſt be their King, &amp;c.</hi> So ſome men have the unhappineſs to be jealous of their wives, though as chaſt women as are in the world, and others are ſo wicked as to perſwade them to it: now this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent, as well as evil ſpirit, muſt be kept, or caſt out by prayer, and faſting, that <hi>London</hi> may be rebuilt.</p>
            <p>A ſpirit of anger, and diſcontent, may obſtruct the building of <hi>London,</hi> as much as any of the reſt, if God ſhould leave that ſpirit to do its worſt? So ſullen as the diſcontents of men do ſometimes make them, they will enterprize nothing, but <hi>will hide
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:45718:115"/>their hands in their boſomes, and not ſo much as bring it to their mouths again,</hi> as is ſaid of the ſlothful man, <hi>Prov.</hi> 19.24. and ſay as he <hi>Prov.</hi> 22.13. <hi>There is a Lion without, I ſhall be ſlain in the ſtreets.</hi> Men in high diſcontent, grow deſperate, and care not what becomes of any thing. This Spirit alſo muſt be caſt out or kept within ſome bounds, by prayer, and faſting.</p>
            <p>There is alſo a private, ſelfiſh, ſelf-ſeeking ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, which muſt be diſpoſeſſed, that any great, and good undertaking, may be carried on. Were all people of that ſpirit, none would contribute to the building of <hi>London</hi> but ſuch as had private ends, and particular concerns of their own. But if compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and good will towards others, and a regard to publick good, do not quicken that work, it will go on but ſlowly, or but little of it be for the uſe, and advantage of thoſe who have moſt need of it.</p>
            <p>How eaſy were it to reckon up yet more evil Spirits, which by prayer and faſting, ſhould be caſt out, that the building of <hi>London</hi> may not by them be obſtructed? One is a Spirit of Strife and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, a wrangling Spirit (as I may call it) a Spirit averſe unto compoſing, and agreeing of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, upon juſt and equal terms, when the caſe is clear, and eaſy to be decided. If the reverend Judges muſt determine all, and every controverſy betwixt Landlord and Tenants, and none of them will agree amongſt themſelves: (neither can they begin to build till they are agreed:) how many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds of houſes will by that means be retarded? nor will ſo much as the foundations thereof be laid ſo ſoon, as otherwiſe the houſes themſelves might have been compleatly finiſhed.

            <p>Seventhly, here is <hi>a ſpirit of ſlumber</hi> ſpoken of, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.8. which if it have not ceaſed upon <hi>Londoners</hi> as yet, it ſoon may, for what more incident to men, when they are ſad and heavy hearted, than to grow heavy eyed, and to fall aſleep? Chriſt having told his Diſciples that his <hi>Soul was exceeding ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful even unto death, Mat.</hi> 26.38. (which words, it is like, filled them with ſorrow too) preſently they dropt aſleep though he had beſought them to watch with him but one hour. There is a great ſadneſs and diſcontent, upon people at this day, and thence no ſmall danger of a Spirit of ſlumber, and ſlee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs to inſue, which is an evil ſpirit, a ſpirit that would never ſuffer the City to be rebuilt, for who can build in his ſleep? this ſpirit alſo ſhould be kept out by faſting and prayer, unto him who never ſlumbreth or ſleepeth.</p>
            <p>And now it appeareth that if <hi>London</hi> be built again in any competent time, there are as many evil ſpirits to be caſt, or kept out of it, as there were Devils caſt out of <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> viz. ſeven, <hi>Mark</hi> 16.9. which I have called by their names. Nay give me leave to conclude, that I am verily of opinion, that all the Devils in Hell (God permitting them) would ſet themſelves to oppoſe and withſtand the building of <hi>London,</hi> which ſhews how great need there is of faſting and prayer, to carry it on, and make it fail as it were before the wind.</p>
            <p>I may not ſtand to diſcourſe the reaſon and uſe of faſting in conjunction with prayer, or why prayer alone might not do as well. Faſting is a practical acknowledgment of our unworthineſs of thoſe good creatures of God, which on ſuch daies, we abſtain from, and by conſequence, of all others (for there is <hi>par ratio</hi>) which are as good as they. By faſting we acknowledg that we are unworthy of meats, and
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:45718:116"/>drinks, and if of meat to eat, much more of houſes to dwell in; which to be deprived of, were the leſs puniſhment of the two. Now they that have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved the greater puniſhment, to be ſure have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved the leſs. Now a hearty acknowledgment both in word and deed, of our great unworthineſs, is one of the main, and moſt prevailing things upon a day of humiliation. <hi>If then their uncircumciſed heart ſhall be humbled (ſaith God) and they then accept of the puniſhment of their iniquity,</hi> Levit. 26.41. <hi>Then will I remember the land.</hi> By confeſſing we deſerve no houſe or home (as by our faſting we do) if we faſt ſincerely) what do we but accept the puniſhment of our iniquity? which is the way to find mercy.</p>
            <p>But ſith our rulers have appointed an anniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary faſt; upon the account of the City, ſome may think all that I have ſaid touching this matter to be needleſs, but really it is not ſo. For firſt it doth not thence follow that the faſt they have appointed will be religiouſly and ſtrictly kept; (and <hi>as good never a whit as never the better,</hi> ſaith our proverb) or that by a great many, it will therefore be kept at all.</p>
            <p>Neither ſecondly doth it thence follow, that one faſt in a year is as much as need to be, or as God doth expect from us, upon ſo ſolemn an occaſion. Rulers may think it not fit to anticipate the piety of the people, by leaving nothing at all to be done by them of their own accords, and as a free-will-offering. Moreover they are to make ſuch Laws, as all or the generality of men may be able to obſerve: Now all men are not in a capacity to faſt frequently; yea ſome it may be (ſo much greater is their leaſure) can better keep one faſt every week, than others can keep two in a whole year. So that though it may be no fault in our Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates,
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:45718:117"/>to injoyn but one faſt in a year, in order to imploring mercy for the deſolate City, yet it may be a great fault in the people (to whom it is as lawful to faſt, as it is to pray, without ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial command from their ſuperiors, as having a command for him that is ſupreme to pray always; that is at all opportunities, and faſting is but a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary concomitant of prayer as the caſe may be) to obſerve no more than one day of religious faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, throughout the whole year, upon ſo great an accompt.</p>
            <p>We read that <hi>the daughters of Iſrael went yearly to lament the daughter of Jephthah four daies in a year, Judg,</hi> 11.40. Now what was the loſs of <hi>Jephthahs</hi> daughter to the loſs of ſuch a City as <hi>London</hi> was: (though ſhe were made a ſacrifice) but if that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual virginity, whereto ſhe was conſigned over by her fathers vow, (as ſome underſtand it from v. 39. <hi>Who did with her according to his vow, and ſhe knew no man</hi>) were all they went to bewail, four daies in a year, one would think that the loſs of ſuch a City as <hi>London,</hi> might better deſerve four weeks or moneths, every year to lament it, and which is more to implore mercy for it, whereas the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Jephthahs</hi> daughter was irretrievable, whether ſhe were put to death, or whether it were only that by her fathers vow, and her own ſuperadded con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, ſhe was obliged to continue ſingle, all the daies of her life. Now <hi>Davids</hi> example may tell us, that when our faſting, and mourning can do good, as he thought it might for his child whilſt it lived, and we believe it may to our deſolate City, then chiefly, if not only, ought we to give way to it.</p>
            <p>How often men ſhould faſt upon the loſs, and for the recovery of ſuch a City as <hi>London</hi> was, can be brought within no rule that will take in every man,
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:45718:117"/>only ſo often as God ſhall afford them real op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities, of which ſome have ten times as many, within the compaſs of one year, as ſome others have.</p>
            <p>But this may incourage us to be as frequent in prayer and faſting, as we can, namely that no ſuch ſervice, rightly performed, ſhall ever be in vain. Phyſicians need not be farther invited to make fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent viſits to their patients, that need it, than by finding they are always welcom, come as oft as they will, and do never loſe their labour. This is juſt the caſe: let us make as frequent applications as we will, or can, to the throne of grace, for our ſelves, or others, in ſuch manner as becometh us, we ſhall be always welcom, and not loſe our la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour once. <hi>For God is nigh to all that call upon him in truth, in all things that they call upon him for,</hi> Deut. 4.7.</p>
            <p>What better or more ſutable examples of praying and faſting, and of the good ſucceſs thereof in ſuch a caſe as that of our City, I ſay what better examples can we deſire than are afforded us in thoſe two fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous men, viz. <hi>Ezra</hi> and <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> Ezra 8.21. <hi>Then I proclaimed a faſt that we might afflict our ſelves before our God, to ſeek of him a right way for us.</hi> Namely when he and others were going from <hi>Babylon</hi> to <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> to rebuild the Temple of God there, <hi>v.</hi> 23. <hi>So we faſted and beſought our God for this, and he was intreated of us.</hi> Se alſo <hi>Nehemiah</hi> 1.4. <hi>And when I heard theſe words I ſat down and mourned certain daies, and faſted and prayed before the God of Heaven,</hi> viz. when he heard that the wall of <hi>Jeruſalem was broken down and the gates thereof burnt with fire,</hi> v. 3. The thing he prayed for, was that he might find favour in the Kings eyes; to go up to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> every way furniſhed to build that deſolate City. Now <hi>v.</hi> 8. it is ſaid, <hi>And the King granted me according to the good hand of my God upon me.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="198" facs="tcp:45718:118"/>
            <p>Now I wiſh that upon all that I have ſaid, the reſolution of men may be to keep that Anniverſary faſt, which the Magiſtrate hath appointed for the City, in the moſt ſolemn way that can be; and over and above that, to keep as many more ſuch dayes in private (though in publick they cannot, without publick leave) as they ſhall have opportunity to do. For as <hi>Iſrael</hi> prevailed againſt <hi>Amaleck</hi> as much by <hi>Moſes</hi> lifting up his hands, viz. in prayer as by the peoples brandiſhing their ſwords in war, <hi>Exod.</hi> 17.11. <hi>(for when he let down his hand Amaleck pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed)</hi> ſo it is a real truth (how few ſoever do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it) that thoſe who are builders, in the common acceptation of that word, viz. Carpenters, Brick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layers and other artificers, do not more truly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to the building of ſuch a City as <hi>London</hi> is (in which religion, as having been long known and profeſſed there, doth claim a great intereſt) than they do, who with tender regard to its recovery, do earneſtly apply themſelves to prayer, and faſting. The bridegroom of <hi>England</hi> (as in a civil ſenſe I may call <hi>London</hi>) though in a ſpiritual ſenſe Chriſt himſelf likewiſe is ſo called) being taken away, faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is now in ſeaſon, for ſaith Chriſt (to which we on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly allude) <hi>when the bridegroom ſhall be taken from them, then ſhall they faſt.</hi> As the mother of <hi>Auguſtin</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted her ſelf with this concerning him, viz. That a ſon of ſo many prayers, and tears, ſhould not miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carry, ſo may we comfort our ſelves concerning <hi>London,</hi> if it be a City, as he was a ſon, of many prayers, and tears, that it ſhall not miſcarry, but go out its full time, and be brought to its intended perfection.</p>

               <p>On Ezra 6.14. <hi>And the elders of the Jews builded, and they proſpered through the propheſying of</hi> Haggai <hi>the Prophet and Zechariah.</hi>
               </p>
            </argument>
            <p>INtending to treat of all the helps we can think upon, as for the rebuilding of <hi>London,</hi> that of good Prophets, who in former ages have been very ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, even to the purpoſes of building (witneſs the text above mentioned) may at no hand be omitted: I have ſhewed before, that good Magiſtrates may contribute very much to ſuch a work, as is in hand, (viz the reſtoring of the City) and now I ſhall make it as evident, that good Miniſters alſo might much contribute thereunto. It is ſaid in expreſs terms that <hi>the Jews builded, and proſpered through the propheſying of Haggai.</hi> It is like, that <hi>Haggai</hi> did not lay one ſtone in the building of the Temple, and yet all things conſidered, no man was more inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental in that work than he, for he it was, who in the name of God put them upon it, and incouraged them in it, <hi>Haggai</hi> 1.4. <hi>Then came the word of the Lord by Haggai ſaying, is it time for you O yee to dwell in your cieled houſes, and this houſe lie waſt? v.</hi> 8. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, go up to the mountain and bring wood and build the houſe, and I will take pleaſure in it.</hi> v. 13. <hi>Then ſpake Haggai in the Lords meſſage to the people ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I am with you ſaith the Lord.</hi> And Haggai 2.4. <hi>Be ſtrong O Zerubbabel ſaith the Lord, and be ſtrong O Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhua the high prieſt, and be ſtrong all ye people of the land: for I am with you ſaith the Lord.</hi> In like manner we find the prophet <hi>Zechariah</hi> incouraging the people <hi>Zech</hi> 8. from v. 7. to 15. and <hi>Zech.</hi> 12.2, 3.</p>
            <p>Now as it is in war, they that beat the drums, and
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:45718:119"/>ſound the trumpets, thereby animating thoſe that ingage in the battle, and drowning thoſe doleful noiſes of ſhriekes, and groans, which would other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe diſhearten the Souldiers, do, or may do as much ſervice, though themſelves do not ſtrike one ſtroke, as thoſe that fight moſt skilfully and valiantly, yea each of them is, or ſeemeth to be, of greater uſe than any one ſingle ſouldier, becauſe what they do hath an influence upon the whole com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, or regiment; putting heart and ſpirit into every man: even ſo may it fall out in building (and every other undertaking of great conſequence) viz. that Gods Prophets, or Miniſters, though it be not proper for them to be mechannically imployed therein, yet may each of them more advance, and promote the buſineſs, than any ten men that are ſo imployed.</p>
            <p>They (if I may ſo allude) are the greateſt build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of all, who (as is ſaid of God) do build without hands. Tongues may either help or hinder more than hands; help if united, and ingaged for the work: but hinder, if divided, as in the caſe of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel.</hi> There was a prophet <hi>Jeremy,</hi> who lived a great while ſince <hi>Haggaies</hi> time, and much nearer to ours, whoſe influence upon the people was ſo great, for the exceeding veneration they had both for his life, and doctrine, that I verily think that the intereſt of ten ſuch prophets as he, were enough to build ſuch a City as <hi>London,</hi> if all <hi>England</hi> could but afford men and monies, wherewithall to do it.</p>
            <p>Doubtleſs <hi>Haggai,</hi> and <hi>Zechariah</hi> were men of eminent holineſs, and that brought them into ſo much eſteem with the people. It was not meerely as they were prophets, nor yet as men of good abilities, that they were ſo much had in honour. <hi>Hophni</hi> and <hi>Phineas</hi> were prieſts, and able men, it
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:45718:119"/>is like being the ſons of <hi>Eli:</hi> but yet the people had no reſpects for them, yea for the <hi>greatneſs of their ſin, men abherred the offering of the Lord,</hi> 1 Sam. 2.17.</p>
            <p>Sanctity is ſo eſſential to a prophet, to a miniſter, that where it is not in truth, or in appearance, at leaſtwiſe, where at leaſtwiſe it is not thought to be; it is, as it were natural to men to withold from ſuch perſons that veneration, and eſteem, which as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets is fit for them both to deſerve, and have: not men of the greateſt parts, and abilities, but men of the greateſt zeal, and holineſs, or reputed for ſuch, are generally they who carry the greateſt ſtroke with the people, as if they thought that ſuch <hi>Elijah</hi>'s could take up others to Heaven in the ſame chariot with themſelves: or that the Ship in which thoſe <hi>Pauls</hi> do ſail, muſt needs come ſafe to land, at leaſtwiſe all the paſſengers be ſpared, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore would chuſe to imbarque with them. The ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſemblance of ſanctimony (where it may be it hath not been in truth) hath made a greater intereſt for ſome men, and made them greater leaders of the people, than the ſubſtance, and manifeſt reality of parts, and gifts, could ever make others. But then ſuppoſe a Miniſter to have the true <hi>Thummim</hi> the truth of grace and holineſs, I mean (which one would think ſhould be more univerſally owned, than the meer ſhew or ſhadow thereof) and beſides that to have the <hi>Urim</hi> alſo, I mean, a fair propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of parts, and gifts, as for his work, a man ſo qualified would compel a very <hi>Herod</hi> to pay him reverence, and to be much perſwaded by him, as he was by <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt,</hi> for the very reaſon, <hi>Mark</hi> 6.20. <hi>For Herod feared John, knowing that he was a juſt man, and a holy, and obſerved him, and when he heard him he did many things, and heard him gladly.</hi> We read that <hi>John</hi> was a <hi>ſhining light,</hi> as well as a <hi>burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:45718:120"/>light,</hi> John 5.35. but it was for his burning, and not ſo much for his ſhining light, that <hi>Herod</hi> did reverence him, and do many things by his directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <hi>Herod</hi> was no leſs than a Prince, <hi>John</hi> but a mean man (to ſee too) <hi>The ſame John had his rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Camels haire and a leathern girdle about his loins, Mat.</hi> 3.4. Yet, for that he was a juſt, and a holy man, <hi>Herod</hi> feared him, who doubtleſs would not have feared a looſe, unholy prophet (one that he had known to be ſuch) no not in all his <hi>pontificalibus,</hi> if for the gravity, majeſty and glory of his habit, he had outvied the moſt reverend Pope. A holy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet commands more reſpect in a hairy garment, and a leathern girdle, and his word ſhall go far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, than ſhall the word and authority of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holy one, were his habit as rich as a very Prince, and his titles of honour, more than are the grand Seigniors.</p>
            <p>I ſee then, if a <hi>Zerubbabel</hi> would have his word to proſper, he muſt have holy prophets about him, as was <hi>Haggai</hi> and <hi>Zechariah</hi> (or thoſe that are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally eſteemed and reputed ſuch.) For otherwiſe it is little ſervice that can be done for Princes, by thoſe that ſerve them in the capacity of Miniſters, or Prophets, unleſs thoſe prophets of theirs are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally in requeſt as good and holy men, whoſe lips the people are willing ſhould preſerve knowledg for them, and to receive the law from their mouths.</p>
            <p>Now every ſuch prophet as <hi>Haggai</hi> and <hi>Zechariah</hi> was, is able to do a Prince more than knight ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, whether he have a City to build, or any other great deſign to carry on. The hands of <hi>Moſes</hi> had flagged, and ſo <hi>Amaleck</hi> prevailed, if <hi>Aaron, Exod.</hi> 17.12. had not held them up, and what is <hi>Aaron</hi> called but <hi>the Saint of the Lord.</hi> They muſt be <hi>Aarons,</hi>
               <pb n="203" facs="tcp:45718:120"/>or ſuch as he in point of repute) viz. <hi>Saints</hi> who ſhall be found able to bear up the hand of <hi>Moſes</hi> whilſt he is conflicting with <hi>Amaleck.</hi> I mean with any great oppoſition, or difficulty; nor can our <hi>Aaron</hi> be well ſpared whilſt <hi>Amaieck</hi> is yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abdued.</p>
            <p>No perſons more able to make the people for any good purpoſe than thoſe prophets for whom they have great reſpects; which can be only ſuch as are generally owned, and accounted of as good, and holy men.</p>
            <p>Therefore they that are ſuch, ought in Point of prudence, as well as upon other conſiderations, to be obliged, and incouraged when any great work is in hand; that by their means, and by virtue of their intereſt, others may be brought in, even the body of a nation, to help forward with it. Such men are certainly the <hi>Chariots of a Nation and the horſemen thereof:</hi> as was ſaid of <hi>Elijah.</hi> They that have a great intereſt of their own, they, and they only, can make a conſiderable intereſt for others alſo, if obliged thereunto. They that are really holy can do much with God, and men, they that have but a great name to live, or for holineſs, can do much with men: they that can do either, are or may be of great uſe to them that ſhall imploy them; but they that can do both, will (where they take) be incomparably ſerviceable.</p>
            <p>If any ſhall object, and ſay, that they of all men are moſt dangerous, if touched with the leaſt diſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, who for their piety, and parts, are had in great veneration with the people; and that <hi>ubi mali nemo pejus,</hi> is moſt applicable to them, that if they have an ill reſentment of things, none can do worſe things than they, nor yet ſo bad: to that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, I reply. We ought not to look at what men
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:45718:121"/>can do, and to uſe them accordingly, but at what men will, or are inclined to do. Doubtleſs God himſelf, could do more hurt to the world, than all the Devils in Hell, put together in reſpect of his omnipotency, but becauſe of his unchangable holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, righteouſneſs, and goodneſs, he can do the world no injury at all. Good men will not dare to do the hurt they could (yet neither ſhould they be tempted to do it, if they durſt) Miniſters that are pious, and capable of doing worthy ſervice, ſhould be treated as friends, and to be ſure they will never hurt their friends, who are taught of God to love their very enemies, they will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver render evil for good, who make conſcience of rendring good for evil. <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Apollo</hi> and <hi>Cephas</hi> are yours, if you be Chriſts: uſe them as your own, and you will never have cauſe to fear them, nor much cauſe to do it howſoever they be uſed, ſith they have learnt to pray even for them that uſe them deſpightfully.</p>
            <p>Good men have a power to do miſchief, but no will, but to do good they have both will, and power: therefore the miſchief they can do is not ſo much to be feared, as the good they are able to do, is to be hoped for and incouraged.</p>
            <p>Surely a bleſſing from Heaven is wont to attend the labours of a good Miniſtry, and the incouraging of thoſe labours, (as well as a curſe to wait upon the contrary) And if the bleſſing of God will not help to build the City, I know not what will.</p>
            <p>Time was, that <hi>David</hi> himſelf was afraid of the Ark of God, and therefore <hi>would not remove it unto him into the City of David, but carried it aſide into the houſe of Obed-Edom,</hi> 2 Sam. 6.10. but in three months time he ſaw that he was worſe ſcared than hurt, v. 11. <hi>It was told King David ſaying, the Lord hath
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:45718:121"/>bleſſed the houſe of Obed-Edom, and all that pertaineth is him, becauſe of the ark of God. So David went and brought up the ark of God, from the houſe of Obed-Edom into the City of David with gladneſs.</hi> He concluded that that which had bleſſed the houſe of <hi>Obed-Edom</hi> would bleſs his City, and doubtleſs ſo it did.</p>
            <p>That building work may be promoted by good prophets, or miniſters, I ſhall prove by one text more, and ſo conclude this Chapter, viz. <hi>Ezra</hi> 5.2. <hi>Then roſe up Zerubbabel and Jeſhuah, and began to build the houſe of God which is at Jeruſalem, and with them <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>That to be deeply affected with the hand of God in burning the City is one good way to have it built again.</hi>
               </p>
            </argument>
            <p>TO be affected with the burning of the City is one thing, and to be affected with the hand of God in burning it is another. They may lament the City with a great lamentation; who take no notice at all of the hand of God, that was ſtretched out againſt it, but altogether cry out upon men, as if evil inſtruments could have burnt ſuch a City, without the great God concerning himſelf in it more or leſs. Whereas the truth is, if men were inſtruments in the burning of it (which for me ſhall reſt upon proof) yet God had the principle hand in it; for wicked men are but Gods hand, and ſword, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 17.14. <hi>Deliver my ſoul from the wicked which are thy ſword, from men which are thy hand.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now God would that his hand ſhould be taken notice of, for he loves to be acknowledged as the authour of thoſe judgments that are inflicted by him.
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:45718:122"/>
               <hi>Who gave Jacob for a ſpoil, and Iſrael to the robber:</hi> did not <hi>the Lord? Iſa.</hi> 42.24. <hi>Is there any evil in the City and the Lord hath not done it?</hi> Amos 3.6. That paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage <hi>Iſa.</hi> 26.11. ſheweth us that God cannot indure to be overlooked when he ſmiteth. <hi>Lord, when thy hand is lifted up they will not ſee, but they ſhall ſee, and be aſhamed, yea the fire of thine enemies ſhall conſume them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That we may be duly affected with the burning of the City, there are ſeveral things to be taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of, beſides that which I have ſuggeſted in the firſt place, <hi>viz.</hi> that God did it. Now that ſuch a God, ſhould burn ſuch a City, a God <hi>ſlow to anger, gracious, merciful, long ſuffering, abundant in goodneſs,</hi> I ſay that ſuch a God, ſhould burn ſo anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, ſo famous, ſo profeſſing a City, is a very affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conſideration.</p>
            <p>Another is this, <hi>viz.</hi> that God did never burn any City but when he was greatly angry. God did ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver burn a City in cool blood (if I may ſo ſpeak of him after the manner of men.) <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42.25. <hi>He hath poured upon him the fury of his anger, and it hath ſet him on fire round about, yet he knew not, and it burned him, yet he laid it not to heart.</hi> I knew a good gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman, who beholding the flames of <hi>London</hi> (by which ſhe loſt not one pounds worth of her eſtate, did thereby receive ſo great an impreſſion of the wrath of God againſt he City, (as her ſelf told me) that ſhe preſently fell into a languiſhing diſtemper (though before of a healthful, chearful conſtitution) and in deſpight of all the remedies which her loving husband, one of the moſt eminent Phyſicians in <hi>England,</hi> could ſupply her withall (which the bills I have ſeen have aſſured me to have been as effectual as could be uſed) ſhe out-ran her husband to the grave, whoſe many infirmities made it probable he
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:45718:122"/>would have arrived there many years before her. If ſhe were too much affected with the manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Gods wrath, I doubt that moſt others are but too little.</p>
            <p>Another affecting conſideration is this, that God is never angry without a cauſe, nor yet above the cauſe given, or more than he hath cauſe for. There is never anger on Gods part, but there is provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation on ours, and provocation proportionable to that anger, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 107.17. <hi>Fools becauſe of their tranſgreſſion and becauſe of their iniquity are afflicted.</hi> If we can ſlight their anger who will be angry for nothing, and they know not why themſelves? to be ſure his anger is not to be ſlighted, who is never diſpleaſed but there is a juſt cauſe, and a good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for it.</p>
            <p>God would that we ſhould be more affected with that wrath of his which is the cauſe of judgments, than with thoſe judgments which are the effects of his wrath. As <hi>Joab</hi> doubtleſs was not ſo much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled for the loſs of his corn, as for the diſpleaſure of <hi>Abſalom,</hi> which was intimated thereby. Surely <hi>David</hi> was grieved at <hi>Sauls</hi> throwing his javelin at him, though it hit him not, becauſe it did betoken the diſpleaſure he had againſt him. <hi>David</hi> doth not deprecate chaſtiſement, but anger. <hi>Pſ.</hi> 6.1. <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke me not in thine anger, chaſten me not in thy hot di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpleaſure,</hi> and it is ſaid <hi>Be ye afraid of the ſword for wrath bringeth the puniſhment of the ſword,</hi> Job. 19.29. as if the wrath of God were the very edge of the ſword, but for which we ſhould have no cauſe to fear it.</p>
            <p>God ſendeth judgments on purpoſe to make his anger known, againſt ſin, and ſinners, therefore ſaith the ſcrip. <hi>God is known by the judgments which he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuteth,</hi> Pſ. 9.16. and Rom. 1. it is ſaid, <hi>The wrath
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:45718:123"/>of God is revealed from Heaven againſt all ungodlineſs of men.</hi> Judgments are the revelations of Gods wrath, and as ſuch they are moſt of all to be taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of.</p>
            <p>How angry was God think you when he burnt our City? It is an expreſſion that importeth much wrath, when <hi>the anger of God and his jealouſy is ſaid but to ſmoke againſt a man,</hi> Deut. 29.20. But in this caſe it did not only ſmoke againſt <hi>London,</hi> but flamed out. Now to be ſenſible of the fury of Gods anger, which hath ſet us on fire round about, and to lay it to our hearts more than any thing elſe, (like inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious children who are more troubled at their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents frowns; than at the ſmart of the rod,) I ſay thus to do, might conduce very much towards the building of our City. For ſaith the ſcripture, <hi>Humble your ſelves under the mighty hand of God that he may exalt you in due time,</hi> 1 Pet. 5.6.</p>

            <p>It is better than nothing to be affected with the judgments of God themſelves (not to be as if we were ſeared with a hot Iron, or paſt feeling) it is better than that to be affected with the diſpleaſure of God manifeſted in, and by thoſe judgments; but it is beſt of all, to be grieved at the cauſes of that diſpleaſure, whether in our ſelves or others, <hi>viz.</hi> our own and the ſins of other men.

            <p>I meddle not with the reforming of thoſe things which men may rationally doubt, whether they be amiſs or no; or with thoſe <hi>peccadillos,</hi> which are like ſmaller faults in pointing, or printing, which no ways diſturb the ſenſe, or make it unintelligible, but with the greater <hi>Errata's</hi> that are committed, even ſo great, that it is hard to be underſtood whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they that do ſuch things have any thing of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, beſides the name, and profeſſion.

            <pb n="214" facs="tcp:45718:126"/>
            <p>But if there be things which every body finds fault with, and which the conſciences (if not the tongues) of all people do condemn, and cry out upon, which they that run, may, and do read the evil of, and the iniquity that is in them, doubtleſs ſuch things ought to be reformed. As the boy ſaid to his Father, Father is that true that every body ſaith is true? ſo ſay I is not that evil which every body confeſſeth to be ſo, or cannot deny ſo to be? and ought not that which is manifeſtly evil to be refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, if it can be ſo? will not otherwiſe <hi>our ſins</hi> ſeparate between God and us, and hinder good things from us? will not thoſe <hi>Achans,</hi> our wilful un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reformed ſins) trouble us continually, and cauſe God to ſay, as to <hi>Joſhua</hi> of old, <hi>There is an accurſed thing in the midſt of thee: therefore ye cannot ſtand,</hi> Joſh. 7.13. <hi>Neither will I be with you any more unleſs you deſtroy the accurſed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for the perſons concerned in reforming, they are as many as are concerned in the rebuilding of <hi>London,</hi> (for therein is its rebuilding concerned) or as many of them, as have any thing that ſtands in need of being reformed, and who hath not more or leſs of that? <hi>For in many things we all offend.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here I could mention divers ſorts of reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion neceſſary to be preſſed, and practiſed, <hi>viz</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal, and that both internal, and external, dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical, national.</p>
            <p>It were endleſs to point at all things which it were needful for us to reform. But firſt of all, if men declare their ſins like <hi>Sodom,</hi> if they publiſh them in the face of the Sun (as did <hi>Abſalom</hi>) if they ſwear and curſe, in all companies, and in the open ſtreet, not caring who hears them: if men, women, and children, do groſely and notoriouſly profane the Sabbath, by working or playing; if they that be
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:45718:126"/>drunk, will be drunk in the day time, and reel along the ſtreets (<hi>as if they had eaten ſhame and drank after it,</hi> as our proverb is.) If Atheiſts will ſpeak blaſphemouſly of God &amp; Chriſt, ſcornfully of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, contemptuouſly of all religion, and that in all, or moſt places, where they come (as if they ſtudied to make proſelytes to infidelity, and to draw others with themſelves to Hell) and if other ſins put on a whores forehead, and a brow of braſs, and appear with broad and open face, as if no body had any thing to ſay to them, or as men might do that were <hi>recti in curia,</hi> I ſay when ſins, yea the worſt of ſins, ſhall in that faſhion, ſtare all Law and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in the face, it is high time to reform. For if Laws cannot thruſt ſinners into corners, and make them like Owls to fly the light, and ſins to become <hi>the hidden works of darkneſs</hi> (as they are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led) the <hi>adulterer to ſeek the twilight,</hi> and to act <hi>ſi non taſtè tamen cautè,</hi> cautiouſly, if not chaſtly, I ſay, if laws cannot confine ſin to thoſe regions of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to which it belongs, without ſome ſpeedy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, Laws will be out of countenance, and ſin will give Law, vertue will be counted a vice, and vice a vertue, drunkenneſs, and whoredom will challenge rewards, whilſt ſobriety, and chaſtity ſhall be expoſed to puniſhments, and as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet complained, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.15. <hi>Now we call the prond happy, yea they that work wickedneſs are ſet up, yea they that tempt God are even delivered.</hi> So it will be again, if the impudency of ſin, and ſinners, be not chaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; and then the ſecond part of <hi>Phaetons</hi> tragedy will be acted, <hi>viz.</hi> Sin got into the Chariot of the ſun, I mean to be viſible, and conſpicuous, 'twill ſet the world on fire.</p>
            <p>Though it be above the power of Humane Laws, (and of thoſe that make and execute them) and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:45718:127"/>the being of ſin in the world, yet not the viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs of it, whereby it ſpreads exceedingly, flows in like a Torrent that hath broken down all its banks and bounds, bids defiance to all vertue and goodneſs, and ſaith in effect, as <hi>Adonijah</hi> did when <hi>David</hi> grew old, <hi>I will be King,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 1.5. I ſay, Laws can ſmother ſin, and fire when ſmothered can do no ſuch hurt as that which breaketh out, and hath full vent. Laws can make ſin, and ſinners do, as is ſaid of the Beaſts of the Forreſt, Pſa. 104.22. <hi>The Sun ariſeth, they lay them down in their dens, and that they ſhall do at moſt, but as is ſaid of them;</hi> v. 20. <hi>Thou makeſt darkneſs, and it is night, wherein all the be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ſts of the Forreſt do creep forth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Laws do a great matter in reſtraining the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickneſs and openneſs of ſin, becauſe private ſins cannot contract publick and National guilt, becauſe Authority cannot prevent them, as they may do thoſe which are publick; neither is God ſo much diſhonoured and defied, or Religion ſo much brought into contempt by them, though God is greatly diſpleaſed with them alſo. In <hi>Judahs</hi> daies ſin ſought a covering, or was made to ſeek it; for <hi>Tamar</hi> intending to proſtitute her ſelf to <hi>Judah</hi> put on her vail; and it is ſaid. <hi>Gen.</hi> 38.21. <hi>When</hi> Judah <hi>faw her, he thought her to be a Harlot, becauſe ſhe had co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered her face.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To ſuffer people to be debauched by ſuch things as have a manifeſt tendancy thereunto, is utterly a fault, and it is plain ſhould be reformed. Our cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt natures need no incentives to ſin; give them an inch of that, and they will take an Ell. I ſhall here mention but two things (though it is like there are more) which have been complained of as great <hi>irritamenta malorum,</hi> great provocations to ſin. The firſt is filthy fooliſh Balads, read and ſung up and
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:45718:127"/>down, whereby (it is ſaid) the meaneſt and younger ſort of people, who cannot go to the price of any higher entertainments, have their minds extremely vitiated and corrupted; thoſe obſcene Sonnets, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as it were, ſhort <hi>Catechiſmes</hi> of wickedneſs, whereby children are trained up in the way, in which they ſhould not go, and elder perſons confirmed therein.</p>
            <p>The other is ſuch Plays (for with ſuch only I ſhall meddle) which contain in them laſcivious, or otherwiſe profane paſſages, whereby (it is obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved) that perſons of a higher quality than thoſe <hi>Catechumeni</hi> of the Devils, who receive their inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction from Balads that are ſung to them free-coſt, and want a few farthings to pay for them) are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriouſly debauched. The Ancients were ſo ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the great miſchief that did accrew by Plays ſtuffed with wantonneſs and impiety, that (as Biſhop <hi>Uſhen</hi> hath obſerved) they have inſerted a paſſage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them in the Baptiſmal Vow, <hi>viz.</hi> that we ſhould <hi>renounce the pomps of the world:</hi> Now <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> (ſaid he) did of old ſignifie Stage-Plays, which ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been found (as they were mannaged) exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly to corrupt the hear's and lives of men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, they laid an ingagement upon children at their Baptiſme, to ſhun and avoid them.</p>
            <p>The ill living, and ill preaching of ſome Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters (I ſay of ſome, for bleſſed be God all are not ſuch, but alas there are too too many of them) is another thing that calls for ſpeedy reformation. Thoſe blind <hi>Sampſons</hi> that are fit for nothing but to grind in a Mill, to turn round and round, where they cannot go out of their way (blind I call them from their groſs ignorance, <hi>Sampſons</hi> from their great ſtrength (yet not ſuch as <hi>Sampſons</hi> was) but ſuch as the Prophet denounceth a woe againſt, <hi>Iſa.</hi>
               <pb n="218" facs="tcp:45718:128"/>5.22. <hi>Woe unto them that are mighty to drink Wine, and men of ſtrength to mingle ſtrong drink.</hi>) I ſay, thoſe blind <hi>Sampſons</hi> have already taken hold upon the Pillars of the Church, and will (if not prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) go nigh to tumble it down upon the heads of themſelves and others. It hath been obſerved of the Papacy, that if the good and mortified lives of ſome few of their Clergy, had not made ſome amends for the great pride and luxury of the reſt of them, that Religion had never been able to ſtand to this day, and it may be verified amongſt us; neither may we truſt to that alone, but ſhould remember what the Poet ſaith, <hi>Immedicabile vulnus enſe recidendum est ne pars ſincera trahatur;</hi> that is, gangreened and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curable members muſt be cut off, or elſe thoſe that are ſound will be indangered.</p>
            <p>If any thing, but what is of abſolute neceſſity, doth hinder the ſpreading of Soul-ſaving know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and its covering the Land <hi>as waters cover the Sea,</hi> I only ſay if it be ſo (for I will leave it to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to judge what is of abſolute neceſſity to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the peace and ſafety of Church and State) we may be ſure that God is provoked thereby, and that the Reformation thereof is indiſpenſable. When the <hi>Jews</hi> obſtructed the Salvation of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> they are ſaid thereby to have <hi>filled up their ſins, and that wrath came upon them to the uttermoſt,</hi> 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.16.</p>
            <p>I am loth to proceed in rehearſing what I think were neceſſary to reform, and ſhall therefore chuſe to ſay no more but this: Let thoſe that have power in their hands, reform but all thoſe things which they think in their conſciences ought to be reformed, and that no good account can be given thereof to the great God, when they ſhall ſtand before his Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal; I ſay, let them reform but ſo much, (which is alſo certainly within the verge of their power,
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:45718:128"/>though there may be difficulty in it) and when they have ſo done, that both <hi>London, England,</hi> and all the three Kingdomes, will reap the happy fruits of it, I make no queſtion.</p>
            <p>And now that I have beſpoken a Reformation, of what is not diſputably, but manifeſtly amiſs, that God may bleſs us in our great deſign of rebuilding <hi>London,</hi> it may be expected, I ſhould expreſs whom I would have to be the Reformers. If then the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion be put concerning the reforming not of a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, or family, but of a Nation, and of ſuch abuſes as are National: I profeſs ſincerely that I am ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly an enemy to a popular Reformation (further than of their own perſons, and families) that is, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the people, or body of the people, or any party from amongſt them, riſing up, and ſaying, This and that is amiſs either in Church or State, and we will reform it: As our Saviour replied, Luke 12.14. <hi>Who made me a Judge, or a divider of you?</hi> So may I ſay to the people, who made them Judges? or who hath authorized them to be Reformers? If thoſe waters uſe to overflow their banks, inſtead of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the Land fruitful, (as <hi>Nilus</hi> did <hi>Egypt</hi>) they will drown and ſwallow up all: The Law ſaith, a <hi>miſchief</hi> ought to be endured, rather than an <hi>inconvenience:</hi> Now for the common people to have a power of judging and determining what is amiſs, and altering all things at their pleaſure, were an <hi>inconvenience,</hi> in the ſenſe of our Law, <hi>viz.</hi> a ſtanding evil, and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of miſ-rule; whereas to deny them that pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, is a rule that is generally good and ſafe, though it ſhould admit of ſome exception now and then, and breed what they call a <hi>miſchief.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As the Wiſdom of God hath thought fit to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute Husbands to be the Head of their Wives, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe though here and there a woman (one of a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand)
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:45718:129"/>may have more wiſdom than her Husband, and could govern the family better than he, and to ſuch it is a <hi>miſchief;</hi> (though but what they deſerve, for chuſing Husbands that have leſs wit than them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves) yet the generality of women being not ſo fit for government as men are, an <hi>inconvenience</hi> much worſe than that <hi>miſchief</hi> is avoided thereby, <hi>viz.</hi> by placing the headſhip of the family in the Husband. The like may be ſaid of Gods placing the ſole pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of publick reformation in Magiſtrates, and men in Authority, and denying any ſuch power to the common people; becauſe though the community of the people might now and then do better things than are done by perſons in power, yet generally they would do worſe, and be the Authors not of better order, but of more confuſion: People may humbly repreſent to thoſe that are in Authority, what they take for grievances, and implore the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs of them, ſo far as to their wiſdom ſhall ſeem fit (beſeeching God to incline their hearts thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to) but that is all they can do. This Paragraph I have added as a grain of ſalt wherewith to ſeaſon what I have ſaid, as touching ſome things which ſeem neceſſary to be reformed, the notice whereof taken with this grain of ſalt, can do no body any hurt: There is no hurt in ſeeking a Reformation of what is manifeſtly evil, but only in ſeeking it from the peoples hands, from whom it is not to be ſought, but only from the Magiſtrate. Could we whiſper in the ears of Magiſtrates, (which we have not opportunity to do) what we ſuppoſe doth need their reforming hand, by my conſent the people ſhould never hear of it, their <hi>Errata's</hi> ſhould be mended (if it were poſſible) before the people did ever ſo much as know of them, nor have we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed to acquaint them with any thing of that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:45718:129"/>but what they knew too well before, and do ordinarily complain of, though not where they ſhould, <hi>viz.</hi> to them that can afford them relief, to whom this Treatiſe directeth all its complaints, (if there be any in it) as to them by whom it is moſt fit they ſhould be heard.</p>
            <p>Reformation is needful in two caſes: Firſt, in caſe there be good Laws, but ill obſerved, notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly broken and violated: There are not better Laws in the World, than many, if not moſt of ours in <hi>England,</hi> as for the curbing and reſtraining moſt kinds of vices, drunkenneſs, ſwearing, whoredom, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but yet alas they abound, as if the Laws were rather for, than againſt them, which ſhews one Law is too much wanting, <hi>viz.</hi> a Law to put the reſt in execution. And verily, they to whom the execution of Laws doth appertain, are the perſons upon whom it is incumbent, and whoſe proper work it is to ſee thoſe miſcarriages, which are contrary to good Laws, regulated and reformed. But ſecondly, It is poſſible that Laws themſelves (humane Laws I mean) may ſome of them not be good, or not ſo good as they ſhould be, and in that caſe a reformation of the Law it ſelf is as neceſſary, as in the former, a reformation by it. I am ſure that Decree of <hi>Dari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> Dan. 6.17. <hi>That whoſoever ſhall ask a Petition of any God or Man for thirty daies, ſave of the King, ſhall be caſt into the Den of Lyons,</hi> was a ſinful Law; as was alſo that of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar, That every man ſhall fall down and worſhip the Golden Image, Dan.</hi> 3.10. Magiſtrates are not infallible, in <hi>Cathedra,</hi> or in the Seat of Judgment; (as the Pope pretends him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be in St. <hi>Peters</hi> Chair) nor do Proteſtant Magiſtrates pretend, that they who ſit in <hi>Moſes</hi> his Chair, whilſt they ſit there, cannot erre; they know themſelves to be but fallible men, and the
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:45718:130"/>Laws of ſuch cannot be infallibly good.</p>
            <p>I confeſs that private men ought to be very ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of <hi>ſpeaking evil of the Law, and judging the Law:</hi> To allude to <hi>James</hi> 4.11. yet Laws may have their faults as well as men, and when they have ſo, there are but two remedies I can think of; and the firſt is, that thoſe who are <hi>Legiſlators,</hi> or Law-makers, ſhould either repeal, or alter them; as <hi>Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar</hi> did his Decree, <hi>Dan.</hi> 3.29. and <hi>Darius</hi> his, <hi>Dan.</hi> 6.26. though the Laws of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians</hi> were ſaid to be unalterable: or if that be not done, that thoſe who have power to ſuſpend the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution of unwholeſome Laws, though not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal them, be pleaſed to ſuſpend their execution. I have only ſhewed how an evil, or ſinful Law, may be reformed, and by whom, but not preſumed to call any Law evil, but that of <hi>Darius</hi> and of <hi>Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzar,</hi> which themſelves by recalling did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge as ſuch.</p>
            <p>But for fear of tediouſneſs, I would preſs hard for that kind of Reformation for which we need not be beholden to any man but our ſelves, <hi>viz. per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal</hi> and <hi>domeſtical</hi> Reformation; I ſay to any other man (as for the two forementioned we muſt be) for the Divine aſſiſtance muſt at no hand be excluded: We need ask no man leave to let us be juſt, and chaſt, and ſober, and heavenly-minded, and chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, and <hi>filled with all the fruits of righteouſneſs which are by Chriſt, to the praiſe and glory of God;</hi> nor yet to ſuffer us to reſolve as <hi>Joſhua</hi> did, and to hold that reſolution, <hi>that we and our houſe will ſerve the Lord.</hi> Let us not pull down that City with our feet, (our irregular walking I mean) which we are building up with our hands. By what I have ſaid, not only the way of reforming, but the feaſibleneſs of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming in ſuch a way, is evident enough: Some
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:45718:130"/>things we have ſhewed, may be reformed by thoſe to whom the making of Laws doth appertain, (and by them only,) others by them to whom it belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to put Laws in execution, and many others by every private perſon.</p>
            <p>Did not ſome think it a ſhame to reform, and to recede from what they have once done: I ſhould have more hope to prevail by what I have ſaid; but ſome do ſo carry it, as if perſeverance were as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary in that which is evil, as in good. I am ſure that ſame is no univerſal rule, <hi>Quod fieri non debuit factum valet,</hi> (that is) that when a thing is done, it ſhould be perſiſted in, though it were ſuch as ought not to have been done. I ſay that is no general rule: For then might <hi>Noah</hi> have perſiſted in his drunkeneſs, <hi>Lot</hi> in his inceſt, at leaſtwiſe <hi>Zacheus</hi> might have kept what he had gotten by fraud, and oppreſſion, which he did not dare to do, but offered to reſtore fourfold. <hi>Pilate</hi> did well to anſwer, <hi>what I have written I have written,</hi> John 19.22. (meaning he would not recede from it) becauſe he had written as became him, <hi>viz. Jeſus of Nazareth King of the Jews</hi> (for ſo he was) but in caſe the inſcription which they would have had him to alter, had not been true, and good, he had been much to blame for refuſing to write any otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>Shall men not be aſhamed to ſin, and yet be aſhamed to repent? Is it beneath us to cry God mercy, when we have injur'd him? Are we better than <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon,</hi> and all other great and good Kings, whoſe repentance is in the ſcripture recorded to all future ages? Is that repentance below us, which was not below them? As ſome do glory in their ſhame, ſo others ſeem to be aſhamed of their glory, I mean of that which would be ſo, <hi>viz.</hi> the manifeſtation of hearty repentance, which
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:45718:131"/>is the beſt thing next to innocency. <hi>Prima conditio eſt non peccaſſe, ſecunda vero penituiſſe.</hi> It is beſt not to ſin, but having ſinned, the beſt thing we can do is to repent. S. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> is ſaid to have gotten more credit by his <hi>Retractations,</hi> and confeſſions, than by any thing elſe: Men will never think faults to be no faults, becauſe they by whom they were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, venture to perſiſt in them; nor yet conclude from thence that they who perſiſt in them, do not know them to be ſuch: for who knows not drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enneſs, and whoredom, and deceit, and oppreſſion, to be heinous ſins, and yet how many do perſiſt therein? He that is aſhamed to recall and undo what he hath done amiſs, is aſhamed to repent: and he that is aſhamed to repent, is in effect aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to be pardoned, and to be ſaved. If men will to Hell for ſhamefacedneſs who can help it?</p>
            <p>How conducing a thorough reformation of what is manifeſtly, and confeſſedly amiſs, would be to the rebuilding of our City, were eaſy to inform our ſelves from many texts of ſcripture; of which I ſhall name ſome few, and ſo conclude this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Who contributed more (if ſo much,) to the building of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and the Temple of God there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, than did <hi>Ezra</hi> &amp; <hi>Nehemiah?</hi> and they two were great reformers, in their time, <hi>Ezra</hi> 10. <hi>Nehem. chap.</hi> 5. and <hi>chap.</hi> 13. How did <hi>Nehemiah</hi> beſtir himſelf to reform the officers of the houſe of God, and the violation of the Sabbath, and the Jews their marrying with ſtrange wives, and their wicked uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry? <hi>Neh.</hi> 5.10. <hi>I pray you</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>leave off this uſury.</hi> Never was there a more reformed, and a more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming King than <hi>Hezekiah, After him was none like him amongſt all the Kings of Judah, neither was there any before him for he clave to the Lord, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted not from following him,</hi> 2 Kings 18.6.

               <pb n="226" facs="tcp:45718:132"/>had agreed they ſhould, ſo ſoon as they had conducted their brethren into the land of <hi>Canaan</hi>) which they promiſed to do) and ſeen them quietly poſſeſſed of their inheritance) I ſay their going to live on the other ſide of <hi>Jordan,</hi> and not on the ſame ſide with their brethren, made that diviſion, or rather was that diviſion, for which there were <hi>many thoughts and ſearchings of heart,</hi> Numb. 32. v. 16. ad 22. If either a river, or wall ſhould part thoſe <hi>Londoners</hi> whom one City held before, ſo as the diviſion ſhould be great, and the numbers of excluded or ſecluded members, (if I may ſo call them) conſiderable, it would be very ſad. For who will contribute to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the rebuilding, and reflouriſhing of <hi>London,</hi> that hath himſelf forſaken it: <hi>ſine animo redeundi,</hi> without any purpoſe of returning to it again?</p>
            <p>Nevertheleſs, juſtly Londoners cannot be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to plant within the walls again, neither may they be ſo threatned <hi>as were the Merchants and ſellers of ware who lodged without Jeruſalem, to whom</hi> Nehemiah ſaid, <hi>Why lodg ye about the wall? if ye do ſo again I will lay hands on you,</hi> Nehem. 13.21. (I ſay it were harſh to compel them againſt their intereſt, to replant themſelves within the walls, ſith many of them have taken long leaſes of their houſes in the ſuburbs, (and indeed could get no ſhorter) and have given great fines, and know not how to put off the houſes they have taken, and to reimburſe themſelves without unſufferable loſs, and diminution. And poſſibly here and there one, is well ſcituated for his buſineſs, hath found the bees to come ſwarming over to his new hive; I mean hath as many cuſtomers, and as good a trade as ever. Let ſuch dwell in the taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacles they have purchaſed, who find it is good being there.</p>
            <p>The mean time let all prudent wayes be thought
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:45718:132"/>of, whereby to invite, and intice burnt-out Citizens, to come back to their old ſtations, as bees that have taken their flight, are by ſuch noiſes, as to them are pleaſant muſick, allured to come back to their hives.</p>
            <p>Here I cannot but obſerve, that in ſome caſes men ought not to be puniſhed for not doing, ſo and ſo, when on the other hand, for ſo doing, they may, and ought to be rewarded, or ſome wayes conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: or that ſeveral things may be incouraged, and and invited to by hopes of reward, which yet may not be impoſed with puniſhments, or threatnings. For <hi>Saul</hi> to promiſe unto <hi>David</hi> his daughter, to be his wife, in caſe he did bring him ſo many fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skins of the <hi>Philiſtines,</hi> was but reaſonable, but had he commanded him, upon pain of death, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, to have gone upon that dangerous ſervice, he had been a cruel taskmaſter. As to the caſe in hand, to ſet a fine upon the head of every Citizen, that would not come back to live in <hi>London,</hi> would be very ſevere and unjuſt, though to propoſe ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable immunities, and priviledges, to them that ſhall return, might be a point of intereſt and true pollicy.</p>
            <p>It is one of the falſe meaſures the world hath been deceived by, and hath done a great deal of miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, <hi>viz.</hi> that ſome men have thoughts there was no <hi>medium</hi> to be uſed, between rewarding, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing; and that all that were not worthy to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded for what they do, ought to be puniſhed, and that if they who did ſo, and ſo were worthy of reward, they who did otherwiſe, or did not as they, ought to ſuffer; which principle is clearly over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown by the inſtances which I have given. If the <hi>Romans</hi> did confer a reward upon every man that was the Father of ſo many Children, it did not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:45718:133"/>that he whoſe loins had not been ſo fruitful, ought therefore to have been puniſhed, and to feel the weight of their loins, or ſo much as of their little fingers; in point of mulct, and infliction.</p>
            <p>Rewards to them that do ſuch things will be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient in many caſes, to cauſe the generality of men to do them, though not every individual per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, though no puniſhment (farther than the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of ſuch a reward) be aſſigned for them that do them not. A double guard, <hi>viz.</hi> one in the <hi>van,</hi> by incouragements, to them that ſhall do ſuch things, another in the <hi>rear,</hi> by inflictions upon them that ſhall not do them, is more than the nature of ſome things will bear, yea more than is either neceſſary, or juſt; as in the caſe before us, in the exciting of <hi>Londoners</hi> to replant themſelves within the walls. Such as have no mind to it let them alone; but ſuch as ſhall do ſo, let them want for no incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, make it as advantagious to them as it can well be made, let their dignities, and priviledges be multiplied, being lookt upon as publick bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors, and by that means the moſt will be brought in. I had not inſiſted ſo long upon this notion, but that I think if it were applied, and made uſe of where, and in whatſoever caſes it ought to be, it might be of great uſe.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not take upon me, to tell thoſe that are in authority, what particular rewards, immunities or priviledges, ſhould, or might be confer'd, upon thoſe who have, or ſhall caſt their bread upon the waters of <hi>London</hi> as hoping to find it again, though not till after many daies: I mean who have or ſhall build upon the ruins of <hi>London</hi> with intention to return thither again. I ſay I ſhall not preſume to ſpecifie, or particularize what might be done for ſuch, for that were to anticipate the wiſdom, and
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:45718:133"/>kindneſs of our Rulers, and Governours, which can better both direct, and prompt them as to that, than I am able to do: ſure I am that perſons in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted with ſupream authority, do ſeldom want rewards, and priviledges, to beſtow upon them whoſe deſigns they have a mind to incourage, and are uſually conſcious to themſelves wherewithall they can do it.</p>
            <p>When the Jews went back to their own land, many of them were unwilling to dwell in <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> fearing (as is ſuppoſed) leaſt the City ſhould be beſieged again, and brought to great ſtreights, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 7.4. <hi>Now the City was larg, and great, but the people were few therein,</hi> and the houſes were <hi>not builded:</hi> what courſe was taken to rectifie that (for it might not be ſuffered that <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſhould be but ſlenderly inhabited) we read, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 11.1. <hi>The Rulers of the people dwell at Jeruſalem, the reſt of the people alſo caſt lots, to bring one of ten to dwell in Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, and nine parts</hi> (viz. <hi>of the whole nation) to dwell in other Cities.</hi> What was done amongſt them by lot, may amongſt us by incouragement; <hi>viz.</hi> the City be planted, and peopled ſufficiently.</p>
            <p>As where the <hi>carcaſs is, there the Eagles will be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered together;</hi> ſo where priviledges and incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements do abound, there will be ſtore of build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and inhabitants.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>That to propound to our ſelves the beſt of ends in building, or attempting to build the City, may much promote the work.</hi>
               </p>
            </argument>
            <p>WE ſeek another City, a new <hi>London,</hi> we ask it of God; (who muſt build the City if e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it be built;) but as we hope to ſpeed, we muſt look to our ends in asking it, James 4.3. <hi>Ye ask and receive not, becauſe ye ask amiſs, that you may conſume it upon your luſts.</hi> Though a good end cannot juſtifie a bad action, or any more than excuſe it <hi>a tanto,</hi> or in part, yet where the end is bad, the action cannot be good. It is a rule in Morality, that <hi>actiones ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficantur a fine;</hi> then, do bad ends always denominate the action bad, how good ſoever the matter of that action be; as what is better than prayer and faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? yet done for ſuch an end as <hi>Ahab</hi> did it, <hi>viz.</hi> to take away the life of <hi>Naboth,</hi> what could be more abominable? If <hi>the plowing of the wicked be ſin,</hi> as it is ſaid, <hi>Prov.</hi> 21.4. then the building of <hi>London</hi> may be ſo too, ſuch, and ſo bad as the ends of ſome men may be in the doing of it; for bad ends, mingled with good actions, are like <hi>dead flies which cauſe the oyntment of the Apothecary to ſend forth a ſtinking ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet miſtake not, as if I ſuſpected <hi>Londoners</hi> to have any ſuch ill deſign, as <hi>Sanballat</hi> and <hi>Tobich</hi> did inſinuate the Jews to have, when they attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to rebuild <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> ſaying, Nehem. 2.19. <hi>What is this ye do? will ye rebel againſt the King?</hi> I dare ſay they mean nothing leſs; yet from other ſinful and unworthy ends in that great undertaking I cannot
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:45718:134"/>excuſe all of them, I wiſh I could, the moſt, or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor part.</p>
            <p>Some may deſign nothing but their own honour, in the ſtately houſes which they intend to build, as he that ſaid <hi>Dan.</hi> 4.30. <hi>Is not this great</hi> Babylon <hi>that I have built by the might of my power, and for the honor of my Majeſty?</hi> That is no good end (ultimate end I mean) as appeareth by what befell <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> v. 3. <hi>Whilſt the word was in the Kings mouth, there fell a voice from heaven, ſaying, O King</hi> Nebuchadnezzar, <hi>the Kingdom is departed from thee.</hi> Others may aim at nothing but gain, and profit, as thoſe St. <hi>James</hi> ſpeaketh of, Jam. 4.13. <hi>Go to now ye that ſay, we will go into ſuch a City, and buy, and ſell, and get gain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I cannot ſay, that either of theſe two ends are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful, if but ſubordinate; but if ſole, or ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme, they are both ſo; for a higher end than ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them ought to be aimed at in our moſt infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour actions, much more in ſo great an underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, witneſs 1 Cor. 10.31. <hi>Whether ye eat or drink, or whatſoever ye do, do all to the glory of God.</hi> Should the glory of God be aimed at, and made our high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt end, even in our common eating and drinking; and ſhould it not be ſo likewiſe in our building a famous City? ſhall God have no intereſt in that more ſolemn work, or tribute of glory from it?</p>
            <p>Some it may be would be reſolved how the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>building of <hi>London</hi> can make for the glory of God, and may think it is but canting, to ſpeak of ſuch a thing: But they are much miſtaken, for doubtleſs God may have a great deal of glory from ſuch a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty as that, if the Inhabitants thereof (and others concerned in it, for they it is that muſt glorifie God) be but careful to do their duty, and to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove ſo great and excellent a talent, as a City of
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:45718:135"/>
               <hi>London</hi> is, for the honor and ſervice of him from whom they ſhall receive it.</p>
            <p>As the Juſtice of God was glorified in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of <hi>London,</hi> ſo may his great mercy be in the reſtauration thereof: It is the burthen of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi> Song, Pſa. 107.8.15.21.31. <hi>Oh that men would praiſe the Lord for his goodneſs, and for his wonderful works to the children of men.</hi> Now the rebuilding of ſuch a City as <hi>London</hi> was, will give men great oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion and provocation ſo to do; and for that, as one great end and reaſon, it ſhould be deſired.</p>
            <p>Doubtleſs it would be a great mercy to thouſands of families, which are now incommoded in their dwellings, and for the purpoſes of their Trade, if <hi>London</hi> were up again, and were they fixed again in their former ſcituations, and ſetled in their reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive Trades, they could ſerve God much more with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diſtraction, and with much more chearfulneſs than n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>w they can, whilſt they lie under great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences and diſcouragements: Now for thoſe ends alſo (which are pure and pious ends) ſhall we deſire, and endeavour that <hi>London</hi> may be reſtored: Now the thorns of care ſpring up, and choak the good ſeed which is ſown amongſt <hi>Londoners,</hi> which care would be over in a great meaſure, if their hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes were all rebuilt, and themſelves replanted and reſetled in every of them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>London</hi> hath been as great a bull-work to Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and as much a Nurſing Mother to it, as almoſt any it hath had, at leaſtwiſe it was in a capacity to have been ſo, and would be ſo again, if it were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain what it was. Now that is another Chriſtian end which we ſhould propoſe to our ſelves in purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the reſtauration of <hi>London, viz.</hi> that it may be a Fortreſs and Fautrix to Religion, and ſtrengthen
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:45718:135"/>the hands thereof throughout <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> if not in other places alſo. <hi>London</hi> hath been that to Religion, that <hi>Locks</hi> and <hi>Sluces</hi> are to thoſe parts of the <hi>Thames</hi> where the water is but low and ſhallow, which by lending a fluſh of waters to the almoſt exhauſted channels, make way for Boats and Barges to paſs, that otherwiſe could not.</p>
            <p>Ask Papiſts if the Proteſtant Religion would not be much more eaſily conquerable by them, if no City of <hi>London</hi> either were, or might be ſuffered to be again; and whether that hath not been always held for a Maxim amongſt the Sages of their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion? one reaſon of it is this, The greateſt ſtrength of a Nation doth lye in that part of it, in which is far the greateſt number, and gathering together of people, where it may be there are five to one of them, that dwell together in any other City: I ſay <hi>(caeteris paribus)</hi> if in other things they be equally ſtrong, that place muſt needs be ſtrongeſt, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently moſt able to aſſiſt others, or ſecure it ſelf, its Religion, and other priviledges, in which are moſt people, and thoſe of good rank and quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, cohabiting and imbodied together in one and the ſame Corporation; for <hi>vis unita fortior,</hi> the main Ocean having much more water in it than any particular River, which do all run into it, muſt needs have a ſtronger tide, and more forcible ſtream than any of them hath: So in this caſe.</p>
            <p>I would have no lower, or meaner ends, than thoſe which I have now named, to be higheſt or up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>permoſt with me, or with any others, as in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the rebuilding of <hi>London;</hi> I ſay no lower to be our ultimate and higheſt ends in deſiring ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>London,</hi> than that men might be raviſhed with the mercy of God in reſtoring a City to them, and
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:45718:136"/>them to it, and give him the glory of it; and that Citizens being delivered from thoſe cares and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexities which are now upon them, might ſerve God without diſtraction, and run the ways of his Commands with chearfulneſs, that undone fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies might be reſtored to ſome good way of liveli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, whereby they, and thoſe that ſhall ſucceed them, might be not only maintained, but encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to <hi>maintain good works</hi> (as the phraſe is, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.8.) and be more intent upon their general, as they have leſs trouble from their particular callings, and worldly circumſtances: And laſtly, that the true Proteſtant Religion (having the Laws of <hi>England</hi> on its ſide) might have alſo an able Champion to ſtand up for it, when and ſo often as <hi>Goliah</hi>-like <hi>Philiſtims</hi> ſhall bid defiance to it, I mean a City a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble with the bleſſing of God, to ſecure it ſelf and the Nation from the violence of thoſe that are the ſworn enemies of its Religion.</p>
            <p>Now what do I promiſe to my ſelf would be the fruit and iſſue of <hi>Londoners</hi> propounding to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſuch ends as theſe in building of their new City? even that <hi>he who pondereth the heart will conſider it,</hi> Prov. 29.12. <hi>and he that loveth truth in the inward parts</hi> (which truth, or ſincerity, conſiſts in nothing more than in having our ultimate ends holy and good) will reward it, and bleſs their enterprize ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly; that if they ask a City for thoſe ends, they ſhall have it; if they ſeek it, for thoſe reaſons, they ſhall be ſure to find it; whereas others <hi>ask and have not, becauſe they ask amiſs, that they may conſume it upon their luſts.</hi> How did God reward <hi>Solomon,</hi> and give him more than his deſire, for asking what might better conduce to a good end, than moſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things, <hi>viz.</hi> wiſdom; and for propoſing to himſelf that good end in the asking of it?

            <p>And now I have propoſed a work to men (men of wealth and eſtate) that will certainly praiſe them in the gates, <hi>viz.</hi> being very inſtrumental in rebuilding of the City: He that ſhall be ſo, is like to have a name, and a renown upon it. Firſt, The name of a rich man, which ſome are not a little
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:45718:137"/>ambitious of: He muſt needs be rich, will men ſay, who built ſo many houſes at his own charge, and honeſtly paid for them when he had done: How few do know, or take notice, what Lands or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſnes rich men have in the Country? they lye out of ſight; but he that lays out his money upon build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the <hi>Metropolis</hi> of the Nation, becomes like a Beacon ſet upon a hill, ſo conſpicuous, that his wealthineſs cannot be hid: Now wealth is more an honor to Citizens and Tradeſmen, than to Country Gentlemen, becauſe in the former it is generally preſumed to be all, or moſt of it, of their own get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, the fruit of their own induſtry and ingenui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which are things worthy of praiſe: To him that was born, it may be, in ſome poor thatched Cottage in the Country, to be the owner and buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of many goodly houſes in the City, what a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown is it?</p>
            <p>To be a great builder, and to do it well, gives a man the reputation, as of wealth, ſo of <hi>wiſdome,</hi> of which the Scripture ſaith, that it <hi>maketh the face of a man to ſhine.</hi> Poſterity will think him to have been a wiſe man, who hath approved himſelf a wiſe buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, having built to profit, pleaſure, and conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; nay, at ſuch a time as this, he that ſhall lay out a good part of a fair eſtate upon building the City, is like to purchaſe to himſelf the name of a Benefactor, who is one of thoſe <hi>good men</hi> the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſpeaks of, <hi>for whom ſome would even dare to die;</hi> meaning by a good man in that place, one that is a friend to others, a lover of publick good; one that hath bowels of compaſſion, a man of publick ſpirit (as others call him) a Friend and Father to his Country, &amp;c. <hi>A builder of old waſt places, a repairer of the breach, and a reſtorer of paths to dwell in;</hi> which are mentioned as Titles of Honor, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 58.12.

            <p>Surely he will be thought (at leaſtwiſe by poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty) to have been a generous man, and one that was not too fond of the world; a man that was far from making the world his God (as too many do, for <hi>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs is Idolatry:</hi>) whoſoever he be that ſhall build a good proportion of the waſt of <hi>London,</hi> for had he idolized his gold and ſilver, he had never ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed ſo much of it to the hazard of fire, after ſo late and great a warning, but rather done by it as <hi>Jacob</hi> did by thoſe Wives and children which he beſt loved, <hi>viz.</hi> put them in the ſafeſt place, (in the rear of his company) leſt he ſhould chance to loſe them.</p>
            <p>Where theſe five ingredients do compound the oyntment of a mans good name, how precious and how fragrant will his memory be? a wealthy man, by his own induſtry, and more than that, a wiſe man, witneſs both his well-built houſes, and the eſtate he got to build them, a compaſſionate man, and one that was for publick good; a man of an undaunted courage, a man that could brook to loſe the eſtate he had gotten, or elſe he had never imployed it ſo as it might eaſily be loſt; which ſhews, that though the world had ſmiled upon him, he did not love it
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:45718:138"/>over much, which others are apt to do though it frown.</p>
            <p>Who is not ambitious to leave ſuch a name as this behind him? I mean who of all thoſe that are capable of ſo doing, that have wherewithal, Say not that reputation, and honour, are but meer ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, and glittering vanities, not worthy to have any thing done for their ſakes. For may not the ſame thing be ſaid of all the things of this world, of which <hi>Solomon</hi> pronounceth <hi>All is vanity and vexation of ſpirit,</hi> that is, partly ſo, commixed with vanity. Now all the uſe we are to make of that conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is to take heed we loſe not the things which are not vaine, and which have no vexation in them, whilſt we overeagerly catch at thoſe things which are but vanity, as when men loſe Heaven, and their Souls, to gain the world, but amongſt earthly things ſome are more eligible (and conſequently leſs vain) than others (for of vanities the leaſt is to be choſen) for <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith <hi>A good name is rather to be choſen than great riches.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now all we call upon men for is to exchange a greater vanity, for a leſs; or to purchaſe that which is leſs vain, by parting with that which is more ſo; that is to purchaſe a good name, which is the leſs vanity of the two, by parting with money, which is the greater. Men that have no ſenſe of honour, generally do nothing that is worthy of it, yet I would not have men too fond of it neither. <hi>Eſt modus in rebus,</hi> Some feel no ſpur like that of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, they may be too proud, and ambitious: but they who are paſt feeling as to any ſuch ſpur, are commonly ſordid, and as much forſaken of a good name, as they do ſeem to ſlight, and contemn it.</p>
            <p>Say not that the houſes thou ſhalt build may ſoon be burned again, and there will be an end of thine
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:45718:138"/>honour. Not ſo neither (I hope,) ten to one but they will ſtand longer than you ſhall live, and be a praiſe and a renown to you all your daies. If ſuch a thing ſhould happen when you are dead, and gone, it would never trouble you, for as we read, <hi>Job.</hi> 14.21. <hi>His ſons come to honour, and he knows it not, and they are brought low, but he perceiveth it not of them</hi> (ſpeaking of one that is dead,) the like may be ſaid of houſes, as of ſons. But for ought you know, thoſe houſes which you now build may ſtand a hundred years together, (as the Royal exchange had done) and it may be a hundred to that, if the building be accordingly: But ſhould they be burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before thy face (as one lately was) that would not lay thy honour in the duſt, or cauſe the houſes which thou haſt built to be forgotten, but rather to be more remembred, and ſpoken of (as was the houſe in <hi>Mincing Lane,</hi> and its owner) ſo long as there was no general, but only a particular conflagration.</p>
            <p>It is uſual to call their houſes after their names, who are the owners of much building; as <hi>Fullers Rents,</hi> or the like: but at ſuch a time as this, when building hath ſo much need to be incouraged, if ſome greater reſpects were ſhewn to them that are great builders, as if their ſtatue were allowed to be ſet up, or ſome pillar erected in memorial of what they had done, I think it were not amiſs. The Holy Ghoſt hath erected a golden pillar (for ſo I may call it) to the perpetual honour of many per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and families, who in their ſeveral proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, did help to repair <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> not omitting the name of the perſon, (and he a ruler too) who took upon him to <hi>repair the Dung-gate, Nehem.</hi> 3.14. <hi>But the dung-gate repaired Malchiah the ſon of Rechab, the ruler of part of Beth-haccerem: he built it and ſet up the doors thereof, and the bars thereof.</hi>

                  <hi>That if the pleaſure that is in Building, were underſtood by all men, more perſons of eſtates would be ingaged in the reedifying of</hi> London.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>WEre I a batchelor I ſhould be prone to think that marriage were a pleaſant eſtate, and had comforts that did outweigh the troubles of it, obſerving ſo many perſons to enter into it, a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, third, and fourth time, who had certainly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimented the manifeſt cares, and circumſtances, which attend it. In like manner, though I my ſelf be no builder; nor ever was any ſuch thing per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally, yet do I conclude there is a great deal of pleaſure in it (to them that have wherewithal) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there are ſo many who ſeem to be never well but when they are building, though it expoſe them to a thouſand cares, and difficulties, and turn to no account of profit, nor is like to do, though they be forced to do it with borrowed money, which they ſcarce know how to pay, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now what but the pleaſure they find in building ſhould make them amends for all their care and trouble, hazard and loſs, which they have ſuſtained by it, time after time? notwithſtanding which, they are wedded to it, and do perſevere in it. I ſay what but the bait of pleaſure tempts them afreſh into the ſame net (in which they have formerly been ſo much hampered, and intangled) I cannot devize. Surely that pleaſure which doth or ſeemeth, to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervail ſo much pain and vexation, as building muſt needs put them to, who are but indigent, and (whoſe bags and purſes have too much room with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:45718:139"/>whilſt they are building more without) I ſay that pleaſure muſt needs be very great.</p>
            <p>And yet the pleaſure which ſome men have, in and by building, having ſo great an allay from their cares, and fears, and ſtraits, cannot be half ſo much as others might have, whoſe purſes and eſtates are commenſurate with their undertakings, and more than ſufficient to build what they take in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>and.</p>
            <p>I confeſs I would incourage ſuch, and none but ſuch to meddle with building, otherwiſe than upon neceſſity. For if the ſpirit of building fall upon others (thoſe I mean who have not money enough to anſwer what they do (for a little money will not anſwer all things, though a great deal can do much) it will certainly caſt them one while into the fire, and another while into the water, as was that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

But to them that have money enough and to ſpare, building is little elſe but a meer pleaſure, greater than that of bathing ones ſelf in a clear, chryſtal river, in a ſcorching day. Building of Cities was that diverſion which <hi>Cain</hi> made choiſe of, when he was moſt perplexed, and ſurely he choſe that which he found to give him moſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aſe. Many know not what the pleaſure of build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is, becauſe they never tried it; who ſhould they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nce try it would find as much pleaſure in it, as they that have found moſt. A manly, noble, uſeful re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treation it is, to thoſe that have a <hi>genius</hi> that way, and can bear the prefent charge of it; and there
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:45718:140"/>is hardly any thing which may be called, or made a recreation, that is comparable to it. As for cheſſe draughts, tables, cards, and dice, which prove to many as expenſive (if not more) than building it ſelf, what are they but childrens play, like puſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pin and ſhittlecock in compariſon of building? and being ſuch can afford no ſuch content to a larg heart, and a generous mind, as building can, which is a recreation like it ſelf.</p>
            <p>Were I to give a reaſon of that vaſt pleaſure which many men do take in building (and more would, if they did but try it) I ſhould chiefly rely upon this, <hi>viz.</hi> that it is natural to men to take delight in all improvements, that are of their own making, to ſee things, as well as perſons, that do (as it were) call them father: to ſee a handſom, thriving off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring of their parts, pains, and purſes, as well as of their bodies, to behold the viſible fruit of their minds, as well as of their loins, <hi>ex. gr.</hi> goodly hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of their contriving, beſpeaking, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Humane nature (as one obſerves) is not greatly pleaſed, ſimply, and only, with our having much, if we make no more of it than it was at firſt, (as if a man were born to a thouſand a year, and ſhould make no more of it to his dying day) but with our making more of what we have, though it be but a little: as if he that was born to nothing, get a ſmall eſtate about him, that he can make ſhift to live upon. To bring this down to my purpoſe, Houſes built in thoſe places which were before ruinous heaps, are a viſible, and manifeſt improvement, which being withal of a mans own making, ſeems to be an honour to him, and to carry ſome image, and ſuperſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his worth and wiſdom, by whom ſuch im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement was made: goodly and well contrived houſes, are (as it were) ſo many looking glaſſes,
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:45718:140"/>in which the builders of them ſeem to ſee the face of ſomething in themſelves that is handſom, happy and excellent: they do as it were ſtand up and call them bleſſed, ſuccesful and prudent above many others: (with many other good names) and this is pleaſing to men, as it is to beautiful perſons to be often looking in the glaſs. If it be a huge grief, and vexation to men (as it is) to ſee, and reflect upon thoſe things, which do as it were call them fools, (as if they have been notoriouſly cheated, and the like) then it muſt needs be as delightful on the other hand, to contemplate thoſe things which are, or are like to be, great demonſtrations, and laſting monuments of their owrth, and wiſdom, as well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>built houſes, are commonly thought to be.)</p>
            <p>Good men have other, and higher reaſons, of that contentment which they take in building, than that which I have given already (though that be common to them alſo) one whereof is, it is a pleaſure to them to ſet poor men at work, to help them and their families, to live by their honeſt labour: Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is, it is for the advancement of a publick good, and good men know they were not born for themſelves, but alſo for the good of others; and therefore build they will, though they chance to loſe by it, becauſe it is for the benefit of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity that ſome body ſhould build, and none but ſuch as they who have plentiful eſtates are fit to do it: What worthy perſon that hath enough, and to ſpare, would not be doing ſomething (though him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf loſt by it, in point of eſtate) that might be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurable to himſelf, profitable to others, and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable to the publick? None are upbraided by ungainful buildings, but thoſe that built for gain, and needed what they built for; but others are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly excuſed by this, they built for their own
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:45718:141"/>pleaſure, and for the good of others: It is well for us, and happy for others, when we make that our own private pleaſure, which is no leſs a publick good.</p>

                  <hi>That men of eſtates would be invited to build in</hi> London, <hi>if the advantage which may probably (though not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly) be made thereof, were duly conſidered.</hi>
               </p>
            </argument>
            <p>IT is not for a Widow, that hath but two Mites, to caſt them into the treaſury of building; I mean, for one that is but poor, and hath no more than will juſt build a houſe, to lay out all that way; becauſe though the profit accrewing thereby may be great, (if no caſualty fall out) yet caſualties lighting upon houſes are ſo frequent, that it can be no mans wiſdom to venture all he hath in the world in that one dangerous bottom. But as for thoſe who have fair eſtates otherwiſe, upon which they are able to live comfortably if the fire ſhould do its worſt to all they have, or mean to have in houſes, they are the perſons that are cut out for builders; to them I commend this <hi>Dilemma,</hi> to invite them to turn buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders (ſith ſome body muſt build, and no body is ſo fit as they) <hi>viz.</hi> the houſes you ſhall build will ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtand or fall, be preſerved or be deſtroyed by fire, or otherwiſe; if they ſtand, your gain will be exceeding great; if they fall, you are able to bear your loſſes; if they be preſerved, you are more than made (as they ſay;) if they be deſtroyed, you are far from being undone.</p>
            <p>Who would not adventure part of what he hath to make a great deal more of it? and who can make more of what he hath, but by adventuring it?
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:45718:141"/>He muſt not keep his money lockt up in his Cheſt, that would have intereſt for it, but muſt put it out, which he cannot do without ſome hazard, and yet who doth it not for improvement ſake? Merchants muſt venture their goods to Sea, (though not all they are worth at once) if they will get great e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates; and venture they do, though they know that Rents of Land (which they could purchaſe if they would) are not ſo hazardous as goods at Sea. The Plowman will not ſow all the grain he hath, but keep a part to ſell and ſpend; but neither will he keep in all out of the ground, fearing he ſhall never ſee it again, but allow enough for his ſeed, in hope of a ſufficient encreaſe: Who trades for all ready money, and truſteth not any one of his Cuſtomers, leaſt he ſhould never be paid? or who truſts Cuſtomers, &amp; makes not ſome adventure, in hope that it will turn to accompt, that Proverb is as true as it is trite, <hi>Nothing venture, nothing have;</hi> though, <hi>venture all, and loſe all,</hi> ſometimes proves as true a ſaying; therefore the middle way is beſt; neither venture all, nor venture nothing, but ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſomething, though not all: And if you will venture (as all wiſe men think fit to do more or leſs) why not upon building; if you have time and money wherewithall to do it? Wo be to us if no body would venture, then farewell <hi>London;</hi> if no body will venture their duſt, that muſt lye in its duſt and aſhes.</p>
            <p>Poſſibly you may make a leſs adventure in laying out your moneys ſome other ways, as upon Land, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which is not obnoxious to fire, ſo as houſes are, but then your profit will be far leſs; Land may yield you but four or five in the hundred, whereas you may probably enough make ten in every hundred, that you ſhall lay out in building within the City.
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:45718:142"/>Now all will agree, that the hope and expectation of a greater profit, may rationally induce men to make an adventure, that is proportionably greater. So they ſay when intereſt was at ten in the hundred, money had wont to be lent upon more ſlender ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity than now it is, when it yieldeth but ſix <hi>per cent.</hi> You ſee how hard <hi>David</hi> ventured to be the Kings ſon in law, even upon the foreskins of two hundred <hi>Philiſtines</hi> by whoſe hands <hi>Saul</hi> did hope to have made him fall, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18.25. but doubtleſs he would have made no ſuch venture to have been ſon in law, to an ordinary ſubject, where the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage had not been ſo great, though he had liked his daughter well. He that expects a great return from beyond the ſeas, muſt make a proportionable adventure.</p>
            <p>Purchaſing of lands may prove more dangerous than building of houſes in <hi>London,</hi> for the title of lands may be naught, and ſo all may be loſt, not only the crop, but the ſoil; but for ſuch as ſhall build in <hi>London,</hi> at this time, all titles are decided, all controverſies determined, before they enter upon their work, ſo that their title is, and will be paſt diſpute. Moreover if fire ſhould burn theſe houſes (which are as it were the crop upon the ſoil) to the ground again, (which God forbid) yet the ſoil would ſtill be your own, and that is generally ſaid to be a third, ſo that your thirds (as I may call them) in <hi>London,</hi> the fire cannot take from you.</p>
            <p>Now admit you have ten in the hundred for all you lay out upon building in <hi>London,</hi> if that City, or your houſes in it, ſtand but ten years to an end (as we hope with the bleſſing of God they may, ten times ten) you will in that ſhort time be repaied your principal.</p>
            <pb n="247" facs="tcp:45718:142"/>
            <p>Then as for Farms in the country, how frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly are they thrown up upon the landlords hands? and no body can be found to hold them without great abatement of rents, ſo that they often ſtand untenanted, and unoccupied. But houſes in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> cannot lightly want for tenants, neither is their rent like to fall, but rather to riſe, as the City riſeth and as trading increaſeth.</p>
            <p>There have been often whiſperings as if the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of money were like to be brought lower (and motions made to that purpoſe) <hi>viz.</hi> to four or five <hi>per cent.</hi> If it ſhould do ſo, money would yield but half ſo much as would the rent of houſes, and beſides the principal would be in as much, or more danger, of being loſt, as our houſes could be of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fired: for men do oftner loſe their principal by bad debtors, than their houſes by fire. The ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarineſs of houſes within the walls for the uſe of Citizens is a conſideration outweighing all the reſt as to matter of profit, for that amounts to ſo much as cannot be well computed. Having then proved in theſe three laſt Chapters, that the building of <hi>London,</hi> is <hi>Bonum honeſtum, jucundum, &amp; utile,</hi> that is, both for the honour, pleaſure, and profit of thoſe that have wherewithal to aſſiſt in it, let him be thought a perſon that underſtands neither one nor the other; that is, a perfect ſtranger to his own intereſt in every kind, (and ſuch are counted none of the wiſeſt) who having eſtate enough otherwiſe, could with the monies which lye by him, or are at his command, contribute much towards the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>building of <hi>London,</hi> and purchaſe to himſelf a great intereſt there, and yet will not do it.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>That the burning of a new and ſtately houſe in</hi> Mincing-Lane, <hi>ſhould not deter</hi> Londoners <hi>from going on with their building, but admoniſh them to build whole ſtreets together,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>LEt me take things as they come to hand, I have been lately advertiſed (and was but yeſterday, fully ſatisfied in it) that building upon the ruines of <hi>London</hi> doth begin to ſlacken, and that for ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral weeks paſt, ſcarce a fourth part ſo many have entred themſelves into the liſt of builders, as have done formerly, which ſome impute to the great diſcouragement taken by the late burning of a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants houſe in <hi>Mincing Lane,</hi> which ſome are very confident was done on purpoſe, and merely in deſign to diſhearten, and diſcourage builders. Whether it were ſo, or no, God knows, and time will diſcover. I have heard the reaſons of that conjecture (or ſome of them) but hearing that one is committed upon ſuſpicion of having been an actor in it, ſhall not preſume to rehearſe them, or to interpoſe my private ſentiment, be it what it will: who made me a judg, or a determiner in the caſe?</p>
            <p>But admit it were clearly proved (as ever any thing was) that, that new and noble ſtructure, did receive its fatal blow from treacherous and malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous hands, I ſee no reaſon at all why <hi>Londoners</hi> ſhould be ſo far affrighted at it, as to deſiſt from building, taking it for granted if they did proceed, their houſes ſhould all in like manner periſh, and be deſtroyed by fire, firſt or laſt.</p>
            <pb n="249" facs="tcp:45718:143"/>
            <p>The burning of that houſe (howſoever it was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, if it were intentional) was (as it proved) but a warning piece to caution others (not againſt building, but againſt the occaſions, and opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of burning) and may (for ought I know) pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>vent the burning of many more.</p>
            <p>Some it may be thought that a new houſe could ſecure it ſelf, and was like green wood, that will not take fire, and (if I miſtake not) the remedies againſt another burning of the City, were not to take place till ſeveral months hence, as if for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent we had been out of all danger, defying all that fire could do to us, partly with our bricks, and partly with the newneſs of our buildings. But thoſe things we have found to be a refuge of lies, and that in deſpight of them, we were more ſecure, than ſafe. When men find that robberies are commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at noon day (which they expected not, but in the night, or dusk of the evening) they will ſoon agree to keep a perpetual watch.</p>
            <p>Suppoſing that houſe to have been wilfully and deſignedly burnt, it may be ſome body had a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular grudg at the owner of it, (which yet is more than I know) and ſeeing it ſtand alone, thought they might take reveng on him and his, without da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage to any body elſe: and if that were the cauſe, all have not the ſame reaſon to fear: for ſome may preſume they have no enemy in the world ſo mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, at leaſt ſo deſperate, as to ſet fire upon their houſes.</p>
            <p>If ſome one or more, had malice enough to prompt them to the burning of that goodly houſe, yet peradventure they had never made the attempt, if it had not ſtood by it ſelf, partly out of unwilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to indanger the neighbourhood againſt whom they had no controverſie, and partly from an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:45718:144"/>that their deſign could not ſo eaſily have taken effect, by reaſon of one or other that would ſoon have eſpied the fire, and given notice of it to ſuch as were at hand to aid, and aſſiſt, the extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing it.</p>
            <p>And now fearing I have not ſaid enough to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with Londoners to build whole ſtreets together (upon which I have ſpent one Chapter already) I ſhall take this occaſion to ſupply what was therein omitted. Some of my arguments may look like a digreſſion from what the title of this Chapter pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to; but if I ſtep out of my way to do my fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Citizens a kindneſs, it is I hope but a venial fault. I may go to far in the diſcourſe of building alone, but I am ſure by the inſtance forementioned, I am fairly lead into it. How much eaſier is it to burn thoſe houſes, which ſtand ſcattering here and there, and which may be paſt quenching ere help can come to them, yea burnt to the ground ere any body diſcern them to be on fire, than to do like ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution upon thoſe houſes which ſtand in the midſt of neighbours? one or other of which will proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly eſpy the danger ere it be paſt remedy, and all of them be ready, to the utmoſt of their power, to put a ſtop to it.</p>
            <p>If that be not argument enough for building whole ſtreets together, I could eaſily produce ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more. That it were ſo agreed upon, were beſt for them that deſire to ſell their ground, beſt for them that reſolve to build, and beſt for them that would fain build, but fear their money will not hold out. Firſt I ſay it will be beſt for them that deſire to ſell their ground, and have no thoughts to build, becauſe in ſtreets that are intended to be forthwith built, intirely (and conſequently ſoon inhabited, and cuſtomed for matter of trade) the ſoil is like
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:45718:144"/>to yield double that value, that can be expected for it, in ſuch places, where thoſe few houſes that are built, for want of neighbours, are like to ſtand (no body knows how long) without tenants or (which is almoſt as bad) without a trade.</p>
            <p>As for thoſe that ſhall build, where a whole ſtreet is building together, they will not be afraid to live in their houſes when they have done (as others are that have built in ſolitary places) nor can they want for tenants, if they have a mind to let them, of better quality than Victuallers, and Alehouſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keepers (the uſual ſeaſoners of ſolitary houſes, with ſmoak, and what is worſe) nor is it like they ſhould want a trade, ſuch as other places do afford, whilſt ſolitary houſes are like to want cuſtomers, as much as neighbours, unleſs the powerful attractive of good liquor, or the deſirableneſs of obſcurity for works of darkneſs, ſhall draw them thither.</p>
            <p>They that have ſoil of their own, in places that are, out of hand, to be intirely built, need not want for money to build their houſes, though they have but little of their own. For ſurely the ſoil it ſelf, and the rent of ſuch houſes, (which we preſume will preſently be tenanted) will be a ſufficient ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity for ſo much money as went to the building of them, and who that hath money to ſpare (as doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs there are ſome ſuch) will not lend upon good ſecurity, and upon ſo good an occaſion?</p>
            <p>Whileſt men build ſucceſſively, and not together, in one and the ſame ſtreet, they give a continual annoyance to one another, and to all that paſs by, like them, that would be in an houſe, in which were ſeveral families, and one or other of them, were waſhing, or ſcouring every day, one after another; by which means the houſe would never lie clean. Now the ſtreets cannot be paved, the wayes cannot
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:45718:145"/>be made good, filth and rubbiſh cannot be all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, becauſe the ſtreets are yet unfiniſhed. We can hardly come at thoſe that have built in ſome places, for the lets, and impediments we meet with from them that are yet to build.</p>
            <p>Houſes that ſtand alone, are like people in a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle condition, from whom it is not to be expected they ſhould multiply: but where whole ſtreets are built together, there is as it were a numerous fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily of married perſons, from whom we may look for a ſecond, and third generation, and who may quickly make their preſent number manifold what it is. Hundreds will be deſirous to build near unto thoſe ſtreets (be it but in by-lanes and alleys) where is a neighbourhood, and a trade having an eye to ſafety, and that there will be ſomething to do: One goodly ſtreet would quickly be inviro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and incircled with neighbouring houſes, on every ſide of it; as if that were the mother, and theſe the children: (the Olive plants round about her table) that the hen, and theſe the chickens, ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering about her.</p>
            <p>Who cannot eaſily perſwade himſelf, that if the building of any whole ſtreets together, and at once, (one or more) were agreed upon, that thoſe Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable perſons who are to decide all controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies betwixt man, and man: as to the preſent build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, would ſo far incourage ſo good a work, as to vouchſafe thoſe <hi>whole ſale Builders,</hi> (if I may ſo call them) the firſt hearing and determining of all their Titles, and <hi>poſt pone</hi> the <hi>retailers,</hi> till they had done with them. Now that by many would be accounted no ſmall priviledg, viz. To have the precedency of build<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ng, whilſt others muſt wait ſeveral moneths longer, if not years, ere they can begin to build, for want of a hearing before the Commiſſioners.</p>
            <pb n="253" facs="tcp:45718:145"/>
            <p>Now theſe five laſt paragraphs you may call a digreſſion if you pleaſe, but I ſhall never repent of it, if it may attain its end, <hi>viz.</hi> to prevail with Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doners to build whole ſtreets together (ſome eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially that are of moſt conſideration (and are the greateſt roads and through-fares) which till it be done, <hi>London</hi> will neither have the conntenance, nor the convenience, nor the credit, nor the clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, nor the trade, nor the ſafety of a City; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will any thing (or very little) be done to thoſe inferiour places, alleys and ſuch like, which are but appendices to more noble ſtreets, and like their hand-maids will wait to ſee them go up firſt.</p>
            <p>But to return to what I ſpake of at the firſt, <hi>viz.</hi> that Citizens ſhould not deſiſt from building, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of that one houſe, that was burnt in <hi>Mincing Lane.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt what will all the houſes they have built al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſignifie, if they ſhall build no more? Is <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> yet any thing like a City? is it fit for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of trade. Though poſſibly more than a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand houſes are finiſhed: and three times ſo many foundations laid? will you loſe all the coſt and pains which you have been at hitherto? ſhall your new houſes ſtand untenanted, and go to ruine? ſhall they have leave to burn them that will, becauſe no body will dwell in them? (for want of neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood and a trade) Is the fine City you had begun upon come to this, or is this all it is like to come to? here a fine houſe or two in a dirty ſtreet, and and there another. Think of that text <hi>Luke</hi> 14.30. <hi>Leaſt all that behold it begin to mock him ſaying, this man began to build, and was not able to finiſh.</hi> What is a mother the nearer for having conceived, and bred, with much ſickneſs, and ſorrow, if ſhe cannot go out half her time? can ſhe rejoyce in the untimely
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:45718:146"/>fruit of her womb? ſuch a thing is <hi>London</hi> if you now break off.</p>
            <p>What diſcouraged by the burning of one houſe! The <hi>Iſraelites</hi> when by Gods command they went to fight againſt the <hi>Benjamites,</hi> were twice defeated, and loſt two and twenty thouſand men the firſt, and eighteen thouſand the ſecond time, <hi>Judg.</hi> 20.21, 25. and yet they went up the third time, and proſpered, v. 30. God would teach us an humble dependance upon himſelf, by ſome rebukes at firſt, when yet he hath kind intentions towards us afterwards.</p>
            <p>I hear the Gentleman whoſe houſe was burnt, is building it again (as faſt as he can) and he is to be commended for it. If the daughters of <hi>Sarah be not afraid of any amazement,</hi> as it is, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.6. Why ſhould they, who profeſs themſelves the ſons of <hi>Abraham?</hi> He hath been twice burnt out, you but once, why ſhould you be more afraid to build the ſecond time, than he to build the third? God grant him ſucceſs anſwerable to his courage, and others a courage as good as his. Men ſo reſolved, would make thoſe weary of burning, who think to make them weary of building.</p>
            <p>Who would comply with the deſign of an enemy, and gratifie him at the firſt daſh? So do they who are ſo far diſcouraged by the burning of that one houſe, as to deſiſt from building, or from the thoughts of it; for they give them what they deſire, whom they preſume to have kindled that fire for no other end but to diſcourage thoſe who had an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to build.</p>
            <p>A wiſe man will not ſeem to be moved at thoſe things which are done, or ſpoken, on purpoſe to make him angry; as knowing he ſhall vex his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, if he can make him think that he is not vexed by him. <hi>Mical</hi> put an edge upon <hi>David</hi> when ſhe
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:45718:146"/>thought to make him leave dancing before the Ark, by ſcoffing at him, as if he made himſelf vile, cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him to anſwer her, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6.22. <hi>I will be yet <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ore vile than thus,</hi> &amp;c. It were better for us to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve that for every houſe they burn we will build two (God permitting) than that we will build no more. If there be incendiaries that burn houſes on purpoſe, ten to one but they will be taken naping (and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, as they ſay) one time or other, and when the actors are diſcovered, the ſnare will be broken, and we for the future delivered. If <hi>London</hi> were once up again, (being built as now it is with brick, &amp;c.) It would not be ſo eaſy to burn it, as it was before, (though God could melt it down if it were all of ſolid Gold.) I ſay in an ordinary way, a general conflagration would be with much more difficulty, and as for particular burnings, men did always venture them, and build as chearfully, as if they had been liable to no ſuch thing.</p>
            <p>The excellent way of blowing up houſes (little confided in, but rather dreaded before) having got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten into uſe, and credit, ſince the burning of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> is I am perſwaded a great diſcouragement to the maſters of powder plots, from making any more attempts of that nature, with hope of a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſucceſs, ſo that if they ſtill deſign our deſtruction, they will take ſome other courſe; in reference to which, either to build, or not to build, may be all a caſe, (I mean) to which neither building will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe us, nor yet forbearing to build will from thence exempt us.</p>
            <p>Not to rebuild <hi>London</hi> for fear of enemies and their new attempts, is no better pollicy, than for an army that were routed to refuſe to rally and come into order again (though they could) for fear of a freſh onſet from the enemy, whom they are in
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:45718:147"/>no capacity to withſtand, or to defend themſelves, unleſs they rally again and ſtand to order. My humble advice upon the whole matter is this. Be not terrified at a probable conjecture, ſo as if it were an abſolute certainty. It is yet undemonſtrated how that houſe came burnt, though much feared, and ſuſpected to have been by treachery. Bleſs God it went no farther. Build not alone but get as many as you can to build near, and about you. Get up the whole City as faſt as you can. The more of it gets up, the harder it will be to get it down. Buds are not ſo eaſily deſtroyed as bloſſoms, or ripe fruit as either of them.</p>

            <p>Charity (ſo called) is uſually but the paring of rich mens nails, or the crums that fall from their tables: and children have no more from them than dogs may lay claim to, (I mean the children of their heavenly Father, than wicked people (if in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digent) might expect.

But alas how few are they in compariſon of them that are otherwiſe! As <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>Prov.</hi> 30.13. <hi>There is a generation, O how lofty are their eyes, and their eye-lids lifted up?</hi> ſo may I of ſome others, there is a generation, O how low and ſordid are their ſpirits? how much harder are their bearts than is the neather milſtone? Too many can ſay to a <hi>brother or ſiſter that is naked and deſtitute of daily food, Depart in peace, be ye warmed and filled, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding he giveth them not thoſe things which are needful to the body.</hi> Men that have more than heart can wiſh, of this worlds goods; how often do they ſhake their heads, and ſay, alas ſuch a man, or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man hath a great charge, and little or nothing to maintain it with; here their bowels ſeem to open,
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:45718:149"/>but they preſently ſhut again: and when they have given them their bleſſing, which is a ſhort ejacula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that God would provide for them, and theirs; they ſeem to think it is enough, as if their bleſſing, like as is ſaid of <hi>the bleſſing of the Lord could make men rich,</hi> or ſupply all their wants!</p>
            <p>How vaſt is the diſproportion betwixt the good which ſome men are able, and that which they do? they give in <hi>forma pauperis,</hi> as ſome are ſaid to ſue, and as if they had more need to receive than to give, as if they were poor Widows they come with their mites. They ſeem to expect a reward for a cup of cold water (or what is next to that) and ſhould not fail of it, if they had nothing better to give; but as the caſe ſtands with them, Chriſt will never return them wine for that water, and they will find as cold comfort in giving, as others in receiving it. <hi>Go offer it to thy Governour,</hi> ſaid God by <hi>Malachy</hi> to thoſe that brought the blind, and the ſame for ſacrifice, <hi>for I am a great King,</hi> ſo to them who bring to this great King ſuch deſpicable loans (for to him it is lent) we may ſay go offer it to ſome perſon of quality, and ſee if he will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it.</p>
            <p>Some have thought that a tenth part of a mans an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual revenue (that was able to ſpare it) was a good proportion to be ſet apart for pious, and charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble uſes; and I have heard of a worthy Miniſter of <hi>London,</hi> who did impoſe it upon himſelf to give away ſo much yearly and found thoſe words made good, <hi>there is that ſcattereth, and yet increaſeth.</hi> But how far are many from <hi>decimating</hi> themſelves upon any ſuch account. Poſſibly not the hundreth part of their yearly revenue, not the tithe of their tenth, is put to any charitable uſe, though they read of holy <hi>Jacob,</hi> who made this voluntary vow to God,
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:45718:150"/>
               <hi>Of all that thou ſhalt give me I will give the tenth to thee, Gen.</hi> 28.22. Of many it may be ſaid, freely they have received, but how unfreely do they give? The rule is, <hi>He that giveth with ſimplicity, he that ſheweth mercy with chearfulneſs, Rom.</hi> 12.8. But how many give as if they gave with an ill will, as if it were rather to ſave their credit, or to ſtop the mouth of their conſciences, than to relieve their needy bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren? nor can they handſomly wiſh that may do them much good, which is of it ſelf ſo little. If I might coin an odd expreſſion, or two, for an odd thing, I would ſay the world were full of ſcrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindneſs, and fragmentall charity, a few gleanings, but nothing of the ſheaves, a few heat-drops as it were, that never ſoak to the root. Here and there is a <hi>Dives,</hi> a rich man that hath never a child, or but one or two, &amp;c. who if he had ten could have made a liberal proviſion for every one of them, yet ſcarce any body is the better for him, worth the ſpeaking; nor would he grudg to ſpend upon every one of his children (if he had twenty) annually more, than now he yearly expendeth upon all that which he calleth his charity.</p>
            <p>Compare the bounty of many to their meer luſts, and humours, conſider how much they ſpend yearly, only to pleaſe their phantaſies, in their moſt wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton and unaccountable deſires, ſo much for ſuch a picture, ſo much for ſuch a flower, ſo much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary for a horſe of ſuch a ſhape, and colour: (and money ſo laid out they never grudg to part with though it might as well have been ſpared) I ſay compare their bounty to their childiſh inſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiable fantaſies (always prompting them to ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluities and coſtly vanities) with their liberality to good uſes, and you wil find the former hath a <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jamins</hi> portion in compariſon of the latter, double at
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:45718:150"/>leaſt, that coſt, and charg, beſtowed upon it, and with more chearfulneſs.</p>
            <p>If rich men are but ſtewards, and not Lords of the eſtates which they poſſeſs, having enough amongſt them for the relief of thoſe that are their fellow ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, made poor by the providence of God, partly on purpoſe to try and exerciſe their faithfulneſs and compaſſion (who bear the purſe as well for others, as for themſelves) I wonder what account they either will or expect to give of that their flew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardſhip!</p>
            <p>Some think to avoid that charg at the great day <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. <hi>Ye ſaw me hungry and fed me not, maked and cloathed me not (meaning by Chriſt the members of Chriſt)</hi> who will not avoid it, for that they fed Chriſt but with ſcraps, and cloathed him but with rags.</p>
            <p>Other nations (as they ſay) do far ſurpaſſe and quite ſhame us in point of charity. In <hi>Holland</hi> (they ſay none are ſuffered to begg, and yet none are ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to want, all their poor are provided for, but in this part of the world, poor people muſt beg or want, yea may beg and want too.</p>
            <p>It is a rule which admits of ſome exceptions, but is too generally true, that they who have moſt, are willing to part with leaſt, thoſe that have many children, and but midling eſtates, do more good many times than they who have great eſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Good uſes muſt needs be ill ſupplied, whilſt all the burthen, or the greateſt part of it, lieth upon weaker ſhoulders; as water muſt needs be ſcarce, whilſt fountains are ſtopt, though ciſterns
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:45718:151"/>run; and it muſt needs be night in the hemiſphere, when the ſun is withdrawn, though the ſtars be kind, and hang out all their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <p>Now underſtand what I have ſaid, as a plea for charity not ſo much from <hi>Londoners,</hi> or the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of them, (who have been greatly exhauſted, and are rather objects of charity, than fit to be the ſubjects of it) but for, and towards them, or ſo many of them as are brought into a low condition, whoſe neceſſities cry aloud to all rich men, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally of the ſame body, as that man of <hi>Macedonia</hi> did to <hi>Paul,</hi> Acts 16.9. <hi>Come over and help us.</hi> As the Apoſtle ſaith in another caſe, <hi>They that are ſtrong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak,</hi> and not to <hi>pleaſe themſelves,</hi> ſo ſay I in this, the ſtrong in purſe ſhould help the weak, and not pleaſe themſelves, with thinking that they have a redundancy, whilſt others want a ſufficiency: but as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>that now at this time your abundance may be a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply for their want,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.14. You may need them another time, as the Apoſtle addeth, <hi>That their abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance alſo, may be a ſupply for their want, that there may be equality.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There could not want money to build this ruina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted City, if all men of conſiderable eſtates would concern themſelves in it, and do as the Jews did by the wall of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> every one that was able ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his part, <hi>Eliaſhib the High Prieſt with his brethren the Prieſts, built the ſheep gate, and next unto them builded the men of Joricho, and next to them builded Zaccur the ſon of Imri, Nehem.</hi> 3.1, 2. &amp;c. Say there were fourteen, or fifteen thouſand houſes burnt in <hi>London:</hi> are there not as many thouſand rich men in City and country, ſome of which were able to build many houſes, and do themſelves no hurt, and all were able to build ſome? which being ſo;
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:45718:151"/>methinks it were a ſtark ſhame that <hi>London</hi> ſhould lie in the duſt, or hang long in hand, as if all <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> could not ſpare money wherewithal to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>build it.</p>
            <p>Methinks it is not handſome, it is not kind, (I had almoſt ſaid it is unnatural) for a rich <hi>Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> a rich <hi>Londoner</hi> eſpecially, to dye and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queath nothing to <hi>London</hi> (in the caſe it now is) in his laſt will and teſtament. Where can you find a better friend, or one that more needs it to receive part of your laſt kindneſs, and of that eſtate which you cannot carry out of the world with you, than is your dear mother the City of <hi>London,</hi> who now fits as a widow, who now cries out to them that go by pity me, pity me all ye that paſs by, is there any ſorrow like to mine? <hi>Is it nothing to you all ye that paſs by? behold and ſee if there be any ſorrow like unto my ſorrow which is done unto me, wherewith the Lord hath afflicted me in the day of his fiery anger?</hi> Lam. 1.12.</p>
            <p>A ſacrifice well pleaſing to God, might do much for the poor deſolate City, and what is ſuch the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> tells us, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.16. <hi>To do good, and to communicate, forget not, for with ſuch ſacrifices God is well-pleaſed.</hi>

            <argument>
               <p>
                  <hi>That the promoting of Love, and Amity throughout the whole nation, would much conduce to the rebuilding of the City.</hi>
               </p>
            </argument>
            <p>IF <hi>England</hi> were at unity with it ſelf, if all the inhabitants thereof were in charity with one another, if fellow ſubjects had that love, each for other, that fellow members of the ſame body ſhould, and uſe to have, or which the members of each body uſe to have for their head, (for ſo is <hi>London</hi> to the other Cities and Towns of <hi>England</hi>) then might we confidently expect to ſee <hi>London</hi> up again in a very ſhort time, and <hi>like a bridegroom coming out of his chamber,</hi> deckt, and trimmed. Whilſt our heats, and animoſities continue, whilſt we bite, and devour one another, methinks the fire of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> is not quite out, but it doth reak, and ſmoke ſtill, ſo far is it from being perfectly reſtored, and compleatly rebuilt. But were we all of one heart (though not of one mind) could we hit upon it to love as brethren from <hi>Dan</hi> to <hi>Berſheba,</hi> (I mean from one end of <hi>England</hi> to the other) were all Engliſhmen compaſſionately affected with the loſs of <hi>London,</hi> and paſſionately deſirous of its reſtaura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>London</hi> would ſpring up again like <hi>Jonah</hi>'s gourd (as it withered like that) I mean in as ſhort a time, for a great City to ſpring up in, as one night was for a gourd.</p>
            <p>No grace like that of love for matter of build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, it builds up the body of Chriſt (the beſt of fabricks) <hi>From whom the whole body fitly joyned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and compacted by that which every joynt ſupplieth,

                  </gap>beſh-gilead,</hi> for not coming up to <hi>Mizpeh,</hi> and gave them their daughters to wives: to the number of four hundred, which proving not to be enough, they put them upon taking every man of them a wife of the daughters of <hi>Shiloh,</hi> when they came out to dance; practices which I know not how to juſtifie, and therefore propoſe to imitation no more but this, that others would be as earneſt for the reſtau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of <hi>London,</hi> as they for the reſtauration of <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jamin,</hi> (though not in the uſe of indirect means) and ſo it will be, if that love be found amongſt Engliſh men that ought to be. They ſaid (<hi>There muſt be an inheritance for them that are eſcaped of Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jamin, that a tribe be not deſtroyed out of Iſrael,</hi> Judg. 23, 17. So would hearty, and univerſal love, each to others, make all Engliſhmen to ſay, there muſt be houſes built for them that were burnt out of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don;</hi> there muſt be another <hi>London,</hi> that a tribe (or what is more than ſo) may not be deſtroyed out of <hi>England,</hi> the utter deſtruction whereof we will la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to prevent with our heads, and hands, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and prayers, and with whatſoever elſe we can uſe and improve for that purpoſe.</p>
            <p>Now if the whole nation would ingage it ſelf, one way or other, in the reſtauration of <hi>London,</hi> and put to its helping hand, how quick a diſpatch would be made, as if <hi>Orpheus</hi> with his harp had made the timber and bricks, and ſtones to come leaping to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and orderly to diſpoſe of themſelves one
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:45718:153"/>by another, as the Poets fained, that he made the woods, and mountains to dance after him.</p>
            <p>But the great difficulty will be to ſhew how, and by what means, the people of <hi>England</hi> which are now ſo much at variance, and enmity, with one another, may be brought firſt not to hate (for that muſt be the firſt ſtep) and then to love, and affect one another.</p>
            <p>Loving parents cannot indure to ſee feuds, and fallings out amongſt their children, to hear them wrangle one with another, much leſs to ſee them fight: nor if there be none of all that betwixt them, are they ſufficiently pleaſed, unleſs they obſerve them to have a hearty kindneſs each for other, and to love one another, as brethren and ſiſters ought to do, who ſprang from the ſame loyns, and lodged in the ſame womb: and when they ſee that, how great is their joy!</p>
            <p>But (as I ſaid before) the firſt ſtep muſt be to take men off from hating one another (a diſeaſe to epidemical in <hi>England</hi> at this day) for which I would to God I could propound a ſure, &amp; certain remedy. How and by what means, the father of a private family, may keep his children from hating, and maligning one another; from fighting or falling out each with other, is within my ſphere to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of, and may be no preſumption in one who hath been, and is the father of ſo many children as God hath made my ſelf, to pretend experience in. I ſhall therefore make bold to direct in that caſe (though not to ſay what would deſtroy all, or the moſt of that enmity, which is between fellow ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, who have all one common and political Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and in that ſence are brethren.</p>
            <p>If parents would not have their children to hate one another, they muſt carry an even hand towards
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:45718:153"/>them, not manifeſting much more of love, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to one of them, than to another, leaſt of all ſo carrying themſelves as if ſome of them had all their love, and they had none at all for the reſt. Parents ſhould temper their love and reſpect to their children, (or the expreſſions of either) though not, <hi>ad pondus</hi> yet <hi>ad juſtitiam,</hi> that is, though not to ſhew ſo much reſpect to thoſe that are but boies, and girles, as to thoſe of them, that are Men and Women, yet as much to the younger, in proportion to their years, as to the elder in proportion to theirs, and ſo to thoſe that are of meaner rank and quality, and apparently of leſs deſert, ought they according to their quality, and deſert, to give a reſpect proportionable, to what they give to the reſt. If this be not done, and if ſome children of the ſame parents, be uſed by them with too much reſpect, and tenderneſs, others with too much neglect, and hardſhip, the latter of theſe will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly envy the former, as <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s brethren en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vied him, becauſe his Father had made him a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti-coloured coat, which he had done for none of the reſt: eſpecially if parents do reſpect thoſe children moſt, which ſeem to deſerve leaſt, it will create a world of envy, witneſs that paſſage of the prodigals brother, who when he ſaw, how his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter was treated beyond what himſelf had ever been, ſaid to his Father, <hi>Loe theſe many years do I ſerve thee, neither tranſgreſſed I at any time thy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, and yet thou never gaveſt me a Kid, that I might make merry with my friends,</hi> Luk. 15.29.</p>
            <p>Brethren and ſiſters muſt not be ſuffered to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther odious, and invidious names upon one another, leaſt thereby they be expoſed to each others hatred. We read of <hi>Joſephs</hi> brethren, that, <hi>They ſaid one to another, behold this dreamer,</hi> (or maſter of dreams)

               <hi>cometh,</hi> Gen. 37.19. and the next words are, <hi>Come now therefore and let us ſlay him, and caſt him into the pit.</hi> It was not for nothing that Chriſt was pleaſed to ſay, <hi>Whoſoever ſhall ſay to his brother Raca, ſhall be in danger of the councel, but whoſoever ſhall ſay thou fool ſhall be in danger of Hell fire,</hi> Mat. 5.22.

            <p>Brethren muſt not be ſuffered to put enſnaring queſtions to one another, like that riddle which <hi>Sampſon</hi> put to the <hi>Philiſtines,</hi> merely to inſnare, and take an occaſion againſt them, <hi>Judg.</hi> 14.12. <hi>And Sampſon ſaid, I will now put forth a riddle, if ye cannot declare it me, ye ſhall give me thirty ſheets, and thirty chang of garments:</hi> but what came of it? ſee, <hi>v.</hi> 15. <hi>It came to paſs on the ſeventh day that they ſaid unto Sampſons wife, entice thy husband that he may declare unto us the riddle leaſt we burn thee, and thy Fathers houſe with fire, have ye called us to take what we have? is it not ſo?</hi> What did it end in but wrangling, when they ſaw themſelves inſnared? Therefore I ſay parents muſt not ſuffer their children, to pore and puzzle one another, with hard and unneceſſary queſtions, to ingage one another in intricate di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſputes (upon great penalties, to the looſing ſide) for certain it is that will end in quarrelling, and that quarrelling in hatred and deteſtation.</p>
            <p>Parents muſt not put their children upon doing ill offices one to another (though they are ſuch as are neceſſary to be done by ſome other hand) for that will make them hate one another. What wiſe Father if he had a Sergant to his ſon, would im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy him to arreſt his own brother? (though for ever ſo great and juſt a debt) as knowing it would be worſe taken from him, than from a ſtranger, and that it is an office ill taken from whomſoever doth
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:45718:154"/>it. How angry were <hi>Davids</hi> brethren with him when they did but ſuſpect him to have come to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them in the nature of a ſpy? It would be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeemly for one brother to be made to ſcourg ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (whatſoever his fault were) a Father would not be hated for doing it himſelf; upon a juſt oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, but ſo would a brother.</p>
            <p>Parents muſt not incourage their children to complain of one another, and to tell tales of one another, unleſs the fault committed be manifeſt, and conſiderable. It is ſaid that <hi>Joſeph brought to his father their evil report, viz.</hi> The evil report of his brethren, with whom he fed ſheep: but did he not loſe their love by ſo doing? is it not probable that was one reaſon for which they hated him? <hi>viz.</hi> for that they lookt upon him as a tell-tale, and an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>former, which ſort of people are always odious (eſpecially where the thing informed againſt is not univerſally odious) and therefore (ſaving in great caſes) had need to be taken up by none, but thoſe whoſe office it is, and they had need be well paid for it.</p>
            <p>Greatly diſcountenance that hatred, and diſaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection which doth at any time diſcover it ſelf, in brethren or ſiſters one againſt another, and let them ſee you cannot bear it, eſpecially if you diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern one to hate another, for that for which they ſhould love them, <hi>viz.</hi> for their goodneſs, for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing better than themſelves. <hi>The ſpirit of Cain</hi> is in too many families, of whom we read that <hi>he was of that wicked one, and ſlew his brother, and wherefore ſlew be him? becauſe his own works were evil, and his brothers righteous,</hi> 1 John 3.12. There are that <hi>ſpeak evil of others, becauſe they run not with them into the ſame exceſs of riot.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let all ſuperfluous occaſions of wrangling, be taken
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:45718:155"/>out of the way. <hi>Saul</hi> adjured the people, that when the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were in purſuit of the <hi>Philiſtines,</hi> that no body ſhould eat any food, that day till the evening: now ſuppoſe that hundreds of the people, being faint, and weary had done as <hi>Jonathan</hi> did, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon <hi>Saul</hi> had cauſed the reſt to have informed againſt them that had ſo done, what a deal of hatred, and heart-burning had that procured? and how much better had it been that the people had never been ſo adjured? Some humourſome ſchoolma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters have made ſuch uſeleſs rules, and orders for their ſchollars to obſerve as have procured nothing but perpetual trouble to themſelves, from the complaints of boies given to tell tales, and hatred to thoſe boies that were ſo given. The like it may be have ſome parents done amongſt their own chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, who afterwards have ſeen their errour.</p>
            <p>If any differences ariſe amongſt your children, take notice of them, interpoſe, and compromiſe them preſently, leaſt the wound of anger, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſion, not taken in time ſhould feſter into hatred. As ſoon as they begin to be foes, make them friends again, for as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith <hi>The beginning of ſtrife, is as when one letteth out water, therefore leave of conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion before it be medled with.</hi> Clap down the ſlluce preſently, remembring that proverb, <hi>Prov.</hi> 13.19. <hi>brother offended</hi> (viz. ſo long, as till he hath fortified himſelf in the Caſtle of his anger) <hi>is harder to be moon than a ſtrong City, and their contentions are like the bars of a Caſtle.</hi> Small heats and differences in the Church (I mean that were ſuch at firſt), when no courſe hath been taken for reconciliation, have in ſeveral ages broke out into a great flame, which hath made woful havock. How much more may a particular family be ruined by an unregarded dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, which was but ſmall at the firſt?</p>
            <pb n="283" facs="tcp:45718:155"/>
            <p>Laſtly, as you would not that your children ſhould hate one another, never ſuffer them to aveng them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, how much ſoever they be, or think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be wronged, I ſay let them never be their own judges, and avengers, but ſubmit themſelves to the determination of their parents. He upon whom wrong is taken for the preſent, will ſeek to be revenged again of him that took it, for though perſons will acquieſce in the deciſion of a lawful judg (as a Father is amongſt his children) yet they will never admit of him for a judg, whom they know to be a party. Duels are ſeldom the end of ſtrife, and boies that fight, and are beaten one day, will try to recover their credit another, not taking the victory before obtained againſt them, as any lawful determination.</p>
            <p>Let parents when appealed to, always do their children right, though they have more affection for one than for another, let them never humour that child which they love more, by wronging that child which they love leſs: for juſtice is as due to one as to the other, and beſides that, the child whoſe injury is confirmed upon him, by the partiality of his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, will be tempted to bear a greater grudg to the injurer, whoſe part is taken againſt him, than ever he did before, whereas he could eaſily have forgiven the wrong which his brother did him, if his Father would but have done him right.</p>
            <p>Theſe rules may do ſervice in a family, and how much farther they are capable of being extended, or now far forth the practiſe of them may take of a publick and national enmity, I leave to others to judg.</p>
            <p>It was needful to ſhew how hatred might be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, or prevented, becauſe without that be done, there can be no love, but yet the meer abſence of a
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:45718:156"/>publick hatred, and enmity will not build our City, without the preſence of love. They that have no ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred to <hi>London,</hi> will not hinder the building of it, but enither will they help it, who have no love thereto.</p>
            <p>But what can be done to make men love one another? what <hi>philtrum</hi> may be uſed in the caſe? I am reſolved, as I am a Father what to do: my chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren ſhall ſee, that next unto the expreſſing of their love to God, I am not better pleaſed with any thing than with the expreſſions of their love to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. If they ſpeak kindly to one another, I will give them two good words for one, if they ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie their love by any handſome guift, or, token, I will take a time to give them twice the worth of it, if they incourage one another in any thing that is good, I will give them double incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment when they do well. Let children but obſerve that their parents are greatly delighted with their loving one another, and that they with the hearts of their parents by it (who cannot indure to ſee them moroſe, and churliſh to one another, harſh and unkind, and are ſure to meet with them for it, as oft as they obſerve them in ſuch an humour, they conſtantly fare the worſe for it, and with them when they are froward one to another, their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents ſhew themſelves froward (as God is ſaid to do) I ſay when children ſhall come to underſtand and experiment this, thoſe ſparks of love to one another which they had before, will hereby be blown up into a flame.</p>
            <p>Call upon children to condeſcend to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and cauſe them to bear with one another, if you would have them to love one another. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcention may as well make way for love, as love for condeſcenſion: it may as well be the cauſe, as the effect of love. Where there is no yielding but
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:45718:156"/>each party ſtands upon his punctillio's, there can be no agreement, and where there is no agreement how can there be love? Perſons that are in treaty of marriage have ſometimes a mutual, and reciprocal love, but ſome things there are which both parties ſtand upon, and neither will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcend to, and ſo the match breaks off; whereas if any third perſon could have over-ruled them, as to the punctillio's they ſtood upon, and made them mutually condeſcend, the match had gone on, and their love had daily increaſed. I remember the time when a certain colledg, at that time full of factions and diviſions, of alſenations, and eſtrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, betwixt party and party, did at laſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcend to one thing, <hi>viz.</hi> To have a publick com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon chamber, to which it ſhould be free for all the ſellows of that houſe to reſort, every day, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe together, as much and as often as they plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. This one condeſcention put in practice, brought them to a right underſtanding each of other, and made them (ſo far as I could obſerve) to love one another ever after: which inſtance I bring to ſhew that a little condeſcention may make way for a great deal of love. The uſe of a moderator (as ſuch) what is it but to make each party remit of its extreams, and condeſcend unto the other ſo far as is juſt and fit? that at laſt they may come to a good comprimiſe; and by that name his ſacred Majeſty is ſometimes called, being ſtiled <hi>ſupreme moderator.</hi> Pride is a great obſtruction of love and peace, for <hi>only of pride cometh contention,</hi> ſaith the ſcripture, now condeſcention is ſome abatement of pride, and therefore muſt needs tend to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of love.</p>
            <p>Another courſe I would take to promote love amongſt my children, ſhould be this. I would hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouſly
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:45718:157"/>reſent it, if I knew of any body that went about to ſet them together by the ears, to breed quarrels, and differences amongſt them: had I a ſervant ſo given, he ſhould never ſtay in my houſe; on the other hand, I would call upon thoſe that are about me, my Wife, my friends, my ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to exhort and admoniſh my children, to love one another, to let them know how great a duty it is, how pleaſing to God, how delightful to parents, and to preſs it much upon them: and but that I would not preſume to ſpeak like <hi>Abſalom,</hi> ſaying were I a great Magiſtrate, &amp;c. I would ſay, were I ſuch a one, I would recommend it to Miniſters every where to preſs the great duty of love to our neighbour, which is a moity, or the one half of the Law of God, and hath as great a tendency to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh a Kingdom, and to make it flouriſh, as any thing that I know, and to farther each particular grand deſign, ſuch as is the building of <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I think of another honeſt policy I would uſe to make my children love one another, <hi>viz.</hi> I would put them upon doing good offices one for another, unbeknown to them that they were inſtigated there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, any otherwiſe than by their own love, and good will. If I threaten to correct one child, I would get another brother or ſiſter to beg his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, with as much earneſtneſs, as if it were for himſelf. I would now and then put a token into one childs hand, to preſent his brother, or ſiſter with, as if it were of his own coſt and charg, that what he hath ſown at my coſt, he may reap in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of love to himſelf, as if it had been at his own. I know as my employing them in bad, and thankleſs offices one towards another, would pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe their mutual hatred to one another, ſo my putting them upon offices of love, and kindneſs each
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:45718:157"/>to other, would ingratiate them with one another, and increaſe their love, as being mutual bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors, and promoters of each others good.</p>
            <p>Did I ſee a child that were of a better humour than the reſt, who both by his example, and counſel, did moſt promote peace, and love amongſt the reſt of my children, I would let that child know that no natural, or moral excellency whatſoever, could more have indeared him to me than that hath done; and on the other hand, that the greateſt excellency of wit, and beauty would not with me expiate, and compenſate that vice, or ill temper, which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary thereunto, <hi>viz.</hi> a diſobliging, provoking car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, a harſh and unkind diſpoſition.</p>
            <p>Now what I have ſaid touching the way and means of promoting love in a particular family, will appear more pertinent to the title of this Chapter, if an expreſſion which St. <hi>Paul</hi> uſeth, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.6. be here conſidered of, <hi>theſe things I have in a figure transferred to my ſelf and to Apollos.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having propounded divers other means for the promoting of an univerſal love (though not every where under that name) that of prayer to God (that univerſal remedy) ought by no means to be paſſed over in ſilence with which I ſhall cloſe this Chapter.</p>
            <p>O God thou art ſtiled love it ſelf, for we read, 1 <hi>John.</hi> 4.16. that <hi>God is love, and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and God in him.</hi> Gal. 5.21. <hi>We are variance emulations, wrath, ſtrife, envyings,</hi> &amp;c. Theſe are the works of our fleſh which are manifeſt, howbeit thou haſt ſaid, <hi>He that loveth not his brother, abideth in death, and whoſoever hateth his brother is a murtherer,</hi> 1 John. 3.15. We pray thee do thou cauſe brotherly love to be, and to continue amongſt us, give us to be kindly affectioned one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:45718:158"/>then ſhall we experiment what thou haſt ſaid, viz. <hi>How good and how pleaſant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity, as the dew of Hermon, and as the dew that deſcended upon the mountains of Zion, for there the Lord commanded his bleſſing, even life for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vermore,</hi> Pſ. 133.</p>

            <p>CAn <hi>London</hi> be lifted up after it hath been ſo much caſt down? can there be Pride in <hi>London,</hi> after it hath been ſo much humbled by ſo great a Plague, ſo great a fire, ſo great a dearth of trade? you may as well ask whether it were poſſible for the heart of <hi>Pharach</hi> to be hardned after ſo many Plagues? and yet the laſt left it rather more hard than the firſt ſound it. How proud are the fallen Angels themſelves, though God hath laid them as low as Hell? inſomuch that the Devil tempted our Saviour to fall down and worſhip him.</p>
            <p>Alas how many lives hath pride? after it hath been in deaths often (as one would think) I ſay after it hath been expoſed to many deaths, yet ſaid behold it lives. Pride is one of the <hi>ſponte naſcentia,</hi> one of thoſe weeds which ſpring up of its own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, and never need to be ſown. We find theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, <hi>Job.</hi> 8.11. <hi>Can the ruſh grow up without mire? can the flag grow without water?</hi> the meaning is they cannot riſe up; (or <hi>pride themſelves,</hi> as one ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth it, the word being the ſame as is uſed for pride, <hi>Prov.</hi> 15.25. and <hi>Iſa.</hi> 16.6.) unleſs the ruſh have mire to cheriſh it, and the flag have water<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="289" facs="tcp:45718:158"/>but Pride in men and women, is ſuch a thing, that it will ſpring up where one would think there were no water to cheriſh it, it will blaze out where one would think there were no fewel to feed that fire, men will be proud of any thing, rather than be proud of nothing, proud of their ſhame (glorying in that as the Apoſtle ſpeaks) before they will be aſhamed of their pride.</p>
            <p>To be humble is one thing, and to have cauſe for it is another. Pride was a ſin that crept into Paradiſe, and ever ſince it hath crept in every where, and diſcovers it ſelf to be in every heart more or leſs. Surely the fire (as great as it was) hath not conſumed all droſs. I doubt ſuch demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations as the Prophet gave of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> their pride, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 3.16. may be given of ours, after all that we have ſuffered <hi>The daughters of Zion are haughty and walk with ſtretched forth necks, walking and min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing</hi> (or tripping ſoftly as it is in the margent) <hi>as they go, and making a tinkling with their feet. If lofty eyes, if eye-lids lifted up,</hi> (Prov. 30.13.) <hi>if a proud look</hi> be ſigns of pride (as <hi>Solomon</hi> doth intimate that they are) if a haughty ſupercilious countenance, if a ſtately diſdainful carriage be demonſtrations of pride, there is ſtill to great a remainder of that ſin even in <hi>London</hi> it ſelf: if an affection in perſons to live above the rate of their condition, to habit themſelves as if they were richer than they are (out of a deſire to be thought ſo, mearly for the honour of being accounted rich.) If exerciſing mens ſelves in things that are too high for them, if an unwillingneſs in men, and women to <hi>leave of their ornaments,</hi> as did the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> when God threatned to depart from them, <hi>Exod.</hi> 33.4. Do ſhew a want of humility, then I am ſure humility is wanting. When God did but threaten to come down in the midſt of the
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:45718:159"/>
               <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> and conſume them, he ſaid by <hi>Moſes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore now put off thine ornaments from thee, that I may know what to do unto thee, Exod.</hi> 33.14. God hath actually conſumed us, and yet we have refuſed to put off our ornaments, I mean ſuch, and ſo many, as ſo great a judgment did call upon us to lay aſide. Do not ſome live at the ſame height in all reſpects as they did before the City was burned? (though they themſelves were great ſufferers thereby) as if they were reſolved not to chang countenance, or to ſeem moved in the leaſt at any thing that God had done againſt them, like ſturdy boyes that will not ſhed a tear, though they are whipt till the bloud come.</p>
            <p>If we for our parts be not throughly convinced, that we were worthy of ſo great a puniſhment as to have our City burnt, and to ſuſtain all that loſs which any of us, for our own particular, did ſuſtain there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by and that we really deſerve never to ſee our own houſes built again, much leſs the whole City toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with them, if we think it was for other mens ſins only, and not for ours amongſt the reſt, that God gave <hi>London</hi> to the flames, or that it was not from any controverſie that God had with <hi>London,</hi> that it was burnt, or from any controverſy that God had with us, that our particular houſes were burnt, but meerly from the malice and treachery of men. I ſay if we ſo think, we are unhumbled to this time, then do we in our hearts contend with God, and charg him fooliſhly, and ſure I am, that, <hi>only of pride c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>If to this day we are ſeeking great things for our ſelves, <hi>viz.</hi> a great renown by the houſes we have built, or do intend to build (which is more than a convenient memorial:) if we are ambitious of vaſt trades (as great or greater than ever) hoping
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:45718:159"/>by that means to run through all the ſignes in the <hi>Zodiack</hi> of that honour which <hi>London</hi> can confer (not content with a reaſonable trade, ſuch as may be ſufficient for us,) if we aſpire to have <hi>London</hi> after the fire, forthwith excel it ſelf in all other worldly things, as much as it is like to do in the magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of its buildings, and cannot be ſatisfied in the thoughts of its doing otherwiſe: (as a man whoſe profeſſion obligeth him to wear good cloaths, ought to be content if he cannot purchaſe every thing accordingly) I ſay if we be conſcious to our ſelves of all, or of any of theſe things, certainly we are proud, and that in ſuch a kind, and to ſuch a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree; as may hinder the building of our City, <hi>viz.</hi> by provoking God to blaſt that worthy underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king: for the ſcripture ſaith, <hi>Prov.</hi> 29.23. <hi>A wans pride ſhall bring him low,</hi> and Prov. 16.18. <hi>Pride goeth before deſtruction, and a haughty ſpirit be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fire a fall,</hi> and Prov. 11.2. <hi>When pride cometh then <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <p>Therefore in order to the building up of <hi>London</hi> I commend the grace of Humility, for <hi>contrariorum contraria eſt ratio,</hi> contraries have contrary effects; If a mans pride will bring him low, then as <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

            <p>Here I expect to be asked what is humility? as <hi>Pilate</hi> put the queſtion, <hi>what is truth?</hi> The anſwer
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:45718:160"/>is at hand, humility is that grace, whereby we are inclined, <hi>not to think of our ſelves more highly than we ought to think, but to think ſoberly, according to the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure which God hath dealt to every one.</hi> That deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion I gather out of <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.3. Humility is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dically ſeated in that faculty of the ſoul which is called the <hi>Judgment</hi> or <hi>underſtanding,</hi> in that faculty is the root of that matter. It is true there are ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral branches of it, but they do manifeſtly ſpring from that root, <hi>viz.</hi> from ſober thoughts of our ſelves, or not thinking of a mans ſelf above what he ought.</p>
            <p>A man may think himſelf as good as he is to the full, and yet not be proud, provided he do not think himſelf to be better than he is, or ſtretch himſelf beyond his line. He that thinks himſelf to be no better than indeed he is, (all things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidered) cannot but be numble. <hi>David</hi> profeſſeth his humility, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 131.1, 2. <hi>Lord my heart is not haughty, nor my eyes lofty: neither do I exerciſe my ſelf in great matters, or in things to high for me, ſurely I have behaved and quieted my ſelf, as a child that is weaned of his mother, my ſould is even as a weaned child.</hi> From thoſe words I gather, that though Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility be firſt (at leaſt in order of nature) in the <hi>intelect</hi> or <hi>judgment,</hi> as the ointment was poured out firſt upon the head of <hi>Aaron,</hi> yet as that precious ointment <hi>ran down upon Aarons beard, and upon the skirts of his garment.</hi> So this grace diffuſeth it ſelf into the affections of men, and into the courſe of their lives, which I collect from two expreſſions uſed in that profeſſion of Humility which <hi>David</hi> there maketh: firſt (ſaith he) <hi>I have quieted my ſelf as a child that is weaned of his mother,</hi> that paſſage ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to relate to his affections, which are the tumul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuating, raging part of the ſoul, and therefore are
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:45718:160"/>called the ebbings, and flowings, or <hi>the tide of the will,</hi> and therefore quieting is moſt properly to be refer'd to them. His meaning ſeemeth to be, that whereas before he had ſtrong, and impetuous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fires, (a great ambition) to ſome things which God ſaw were yet to high for him, as namely to come to the throne, which God had promiſed him, I ſay whereas before he longed to be in poſſeſſion of that earthly Kingdom, which was promiſed him (as a child might long for the breaſt) yet now God had humbled him, for ſo he ſaith, <hi>my heart is not haughty,</hi> he had no more deſire to it (till the time that God had appointed ſhould be fulfilled) than a child hath to that breaſt, from which it hath been fully weaned.</p>
            <p>A mean and modeſt opinion, and judgment of a mans ſelf, killeth ambition at the very root, and mortifieth our deſires to thoſe things that are too high for us, as being ſenſible they would not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come us; as a poor labouring man is not ambitious to ride up and down in a Coach continually, as knowing it would no ways ſuit his birth, and breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and poor condition.</p>
            <p>He then is an humble man, who deſires not any thing that is too great for him (as too great an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem, &amp;c.) and therefore deſires it not becauſe he is ſenſible he doth not deſerve it, it would not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come him as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>Excellent ſpeech becometh not a fool,</hi> Prov. 17.7. <hi>And honour is not ſeemly for a fool,</hi> Prov. 26.1. It would ill become him, as a Crown and Scepter, would do the head, and hand, of one that is but a mean ſubject. Men are not am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious of thoſe things that are extreamly above them, becauſe they cannot but ſee, and known that they are above them, but of ſuch things as are not very much too high for them, proud men are am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious, becauſe their pride and ſelf-love cauſeth
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:45718:161"/>them to think they may and do deſerve them. Now an humble man not thinking of himſelf above what is meet, knows what he deſerves not, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon deſireth no more than what he doth really de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, and conſequently is not ambitious, for am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition is the deſire of things that are too high for us.</p>
            <p>Then from thoſe words of <hi>David, nor my eyes are not lofty, neither do I exerciſe my ſelf in things too high for me.</hi> I ſay from thence may be collected that the grace of Humility, as it is poured into the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſo it is poured out upon the life, as it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed upon the whole inward man, ſo it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in the outward; an humble inſide and a proud outſide, are inconſiſtent: an humble heart, and a haughty look, a heart caſt down with true humility, and eyes mean time lifted up with pride, and a perſon exerciſing himſelf generally in things that are too high for him, are incompatible. Now the two latter, <hi>viz.</hi> The not exerciſing himſelf in things that are too high for him, and the quieting of himſelf as a weaned child, did proceed from the firſt, <hi>viz.</hi> that his <hi>heart was not haughty,</hi> that is, that he had no high conceit of himſelf, and of his own deſerts. Nor do I remember any one expreſſion whereby humility is ſet forth, and recommended, that is not reducible unto mean thoughts of a mans ſelf, or not thinking of our ſelves more highly than we ought, as the root and original of it.</p>
            <p>One phraſe whereby the Apoſtle expreſſeth Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility is this; <hi>In lowlineſs of mind let each eſteem other better than themſelves,</hi> Phil. 2.3. And to like purpoſe with that, are thoſe words, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.10. <hi>In honor preferring one another.</hi> What but mean thoughts of a mans ſelf doth make him, in honor to prefer others, and to eſteem them better than him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf? neither need any man to miſconceive of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:45718:161"/>or think of himſelf worſe than he is, that he may think others better than himſelf: that is, <hi>ſecundum quid,</hi> I mean ſo in one reſpect, or other. For they that in moſt things excel others, are uſually in ſome things excelled by them. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.8. <hi>For to one is given by the ſpirit the word of wiſdom, to another the word of knowledg, to another faith, to another the gifts of healing, to another prophecy, to another divers kinds of tongues, to another the interpretation of tongues.</hi> Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity gives a man to ſee, and own what gift another man hath, which he hath not, or not in ſo eminent a degree, and meaſure, as another hath it. So when the Apoſtle ſaith as it is, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.16. <hi>Mind not high things but condeſcend to men of low eſtate</hi> (or be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with mean things, as it is in the margent) he adds that which if practiſed, will cauſe men to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcend, and that is, <hi>Be not wiſe in your own conceits,</hi> or have low thoughts of your ſelves. Humble looks, humble geſtures, humble ſpeeches and expreſſions, an humble, modeſt, plain garb, and habit, and ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abaſing equipage (as was that of Chriſt when he rode upon an aſſe, the foal of an Aſſe) ſo far as there is fincerity in thoſe external appearances (which I add becauſe ſome in ſuch things may but, <hi>induere perſonam;</hi> that is, may but act a part) do all ſpring from lowly thoughts of our ſelves: as did the meek carriage of the <hi>Publican</hi> Luk. 18.10. <hi>And the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican ſtanding afar off would not lift up ſo much as his eyes to Heaven but ſmote upon his breaſt ſaying God be merciful to me a ſinner,</hi> which laſt words give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of all the former, he was caſt down with the thoughts of his being a great ſinner, and that made him do as he did.</p>
            <p>Every man would think meanly of himſelf, and be little in his own eyes, if he did think ſoberly of himſelf, and not more highly than he ought, or
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:45718:162"/>hath reaſon to think, for the ſcripture ſaith that <hi>every man at his beſt eſtate is altogether vanity,</hi> Pſ. 39.5. <hi>and ſurely men of low degree are vanity, and men of high degree are a lye, to be laid in the ballance they are altogether lighter than vanity,</hi> Pſ. 62.9.</p>
            <p>We ſay of proud people that <hi>they do not know them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,</hi> and when we promiſe to humble them, we ſay <hi>we will make them know themſelves,</hi> and moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it is if the beſt, and worthieſt and happieſt of men and women, did throughly know themſelves they could not be proud. For how can he be proud who knoweth, and is convinced, that he hath many things to caſt him down; but no one thing that may juſtly lift him up, all things conſidered? Now that is every mans caſe.</p>
            <p>Who laboureth not under natural defects, finful defilements, and Divine rebukes? and all of theſe are juſt occaſions of being caſt down. Doth the wiſe man glory in his wiſdom, alas how defective is it? how little do the beſt Philoſophers know of the true reaſons of any thing in nature? We know the uſe of things but litle of their cauſes, our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg both of God and of the creatures, is not ſo much by a thouſand parts as is our ignorance. <hi>Job</hi> ſpeaking of God ſaith, <hi>Lo theſe are parts of his wayes but how little a portion is heard of him.</hi> Job 26.24. Our wiſdom in compariſon of the wiſdom of God is but fooliſhneſs; yea compared with the wiſdom of Angels, yea of fallen Angels, is but weakneſs. He ſpake as truly, as modeſtly, who ſaid, <hi>This only do I know, that I know nothing (Hoc tantum ſcio me nihil ſcire) viz.</hi> In compariſon of the many things which he was ignorant of, and yet he was one of the wiſeſt men in the world that ſaid it. If the ſtrong man glory in his ſtrength, how defective is that ſtrength wherein he glorieth? and how much more doth he
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:45718:162"/>partake of weakneſs? How ſoon were <hi>Sampſons</hi> locks cut off, and when that was done, what became of his ſtrength? How eaſily can a diſeaſe (ſuch as it may be) take hold upon the pillars of his houſe (who thinks his body to be as it were an impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Caſtle) and pull it preſently about his ears? as <hi>Sampſon</hi> ſerved the <hi>Philiſtines.</hi> How defective muſt they needs be otherwiſe, and in other reſpects, who have ſo much of defect in their greateſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies, and perfections? few men excel in many things, none in all, and if ſuch be the imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of mens greateſt perfections, how many defects and imperfections have all men to keep them humble?</p>
            <p>Beſides natural defects there are ſinful defile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which is yet a more humbling conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 19.12. <hi>Who can underſtand his errors? viz.</hi> the vaſt number the haynous nature of them. Had we all kind of natural excellencies, <hi>viz.</hi> wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, ſtrength, beauty, yet ought we to abhor our ſelves as in duſt, and aſhes; for our moral polluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Devils want not for natural excellencies, they have ſtrength and wiſdom far beyond any man in the world, but being abominably wicked (in ſpight of all that where in they excell) we count them odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and deſpicable creatures. S. <hi>Paul</hi> though an Apoſtle of extraordinary indowments, both acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, natural and ſupernatural, yet cried out (as one that was vile in his own account) <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.24. <hi>O wretched man that I am, who ſhall deliver me from this body of death.</hi> He that ſhall ſet his <hi>guilt</hi> againſt his gifts, will find the former exceedingly to outweigh the latter, and to miniſter to him much more cauſe of humility, than the other can do of pride to have: a heart deceitful above meaſure, and deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately wicked, (as who hath not) and together with
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:45718:163"/>that a life defiled with thouſands of actual tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions, how much greater a cauſe of ſelf abaſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is it, than to have a great deal of wealth, power and wiſdom, can be of ſelf exaltation? One would think, that <hi>Naamans</hi> leproſy ſhould keep him humble, though he were a great commander, and is there not reaſon for us ſo to be upon every one of whom there is a worſe leproſy: (though more inviſible) than was that of <hi>Naamans;</hi> the leproſy of ſin I mean.</p>
            <p>Think but of ſin under the notion of <hi>folly,</hi> as both ſcripture, and reaſon do repreſent it, and ſinners as fools, and it will help to humble thee, for who is not vile in his own eyes, when he is conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to himſelf, that he hath notoriouſly plaied the fool, as <hi>Tamar</hi> ſaid to <hi>Amnon,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 13.13. <hi>And thou ſhalt be as one of the fools in Iſrael:</hi> and when he had committed that folly, and came to reflect upon it, how out of countenance was he? how mad with her, and ſurely more with himſelf, for the fault was not hers, but his. If ſinners have not done foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhly, why do they repent when their eyes are opened? Or why is repentance called by the latines <hi>Reſipiſcentia,</hi> that is, a return to wiſdom, and by the Greeks <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, as who ſhould ſay an after wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom? Awakened ſinners have plaied the fools, themſelves being judges, and having ſo done have great cauſe to be humbled, and as it were to lay their mouths in the duſt, or cover their faces. He that can view his ſins, and not be humbled at the ſight thereof, can ſee his Saviour pierced and not mourn.</p>
            <p>To bring down the pride of man beſides natural defects, and moral defilements (which he that knoweth himſelf cannot be ignorant of) there are <hi>Divine Rebukes</hi> which moſt men have fallen under,
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:45718:163"/>one time or other. Now the chaſtiſements of God are intended for the <hi>hiding of pride from man,</hi> Job 33.17, 19. As God ſaid to <hi>Moſes</hi> concerning <hi>Miriam, If her father had but ſpit in her face, ſhould ſhe not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed ſeven dayes?</hi> Numb. 12.14. So it is intended, that when God by his Judgments doth as it were ſpit in the faces of men, it ſhould put them to ſhame, and ſhame is an humbling paſſion. So good a Father had never beaten us with ſo many ſtripes, had never fetcht the bloud on us (as he hath ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times done) if we had been good children; yea, if we had not bin very bad. Our ſufferings may there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore humble us, becauſe in them we may read our ſins, as comming from his hand who doth not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly, or without cauſe afflict the children of men, <hi>but if the living man complain, it is for the puniſhment of his ſin.</hi> Hath God ſmitten us; yea, is he ſmiting, and ſhall we mean time be ſupercilious? ſhall we knit our brows in pride, whilſt he bends his brows in anger? ſhall we nouriſh haughtineſs under Gods frowns? <hi>Say unto God how terrible art thou in thy works?</hi> Pſal. 66.3. <hi>God is terrible in his doing toward the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of men,</hi> v. 5. it followeth v. 7. <hi>Let not the Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious exalt themſelves.</hi> Fear is an humbling affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Put them in fear,</hi> ſaith the Pſalmiſt, <hi>that they may know themſelves to be but men.</hi> Now <hi>when the Lion roar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  </gap>th, who will not fear?</hi> Amos 3.8. That is, when God diſplaieth his anger, ought not every one to tremble at it? Notable is that paſſage, <hi>Job</hi> 9.13. <hi>If God will not withdraw his anger, the proud helpers do ſtoop un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him.</hi> So far are men from ſwelling with pride, when they take notice of Gods rebukes, that <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>When thou</hi> (that is God) <hi>doſt correct man for ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, thou makeſt his beauty to conſume away like a moth,</hi> Pſal. 39.11. He that ſhall often look his face in that glaſs which ſhall repreſent to him thoſe three
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:45718:164"/>things which I laſt mentioned, <hi>viz.</hi> his natural and ſpiritual defects (which are many and great in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, though not in compariſon of other men) his moral defilements, and pollutions; that is, his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable ſins: and laſtly, thoſe many rebukes wherewith God hath corrected him for ſin: I ſay, he who in the mirror of ſerious <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ontemplation ſhall frequently behold theſe three things, and whilſt he layeth all his endowments and enjoyments in one ſcale, ſhall lay theſe in the other, cannot eaſily be lifted up, or think of himſelf more highly than he ought.</p>
            <p>I have evinced that every man hath much to be humbled for, and under: If I can alſo prove that no man hath any thing to be proud of, or cauſe to be proud of any thing; when that is made good, I ſhall then have demonſtrated that he muſt needs be hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that doth but throughly know himſelf, and that doth judg himſelf no better, though no worſe nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than indeed he is.</p>
            <p>There are but four ſorts of things that any man in the world can take a pride in, <hi>viz. What he is, what he hath, what he hath done;</hi> And laſtly, <hi>What he hath ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered upon a good account.</hi> As for the firſt of theſe, a man may know what he is (as that he is a child of God, &amp;c.) and yet not be proud of it, <hi>John</hi> 3.14. <hi>We know that we have paſſed from death to life, &amp;c.</hi> 1 Joh. 5.19. <hi>We know that we are of God, &amp;c.</hi> For why ſhould a man be proud of what he is by the meer grace and favor of God? It was no pride in St. <hi>Paul</hi> to ſay, <hi>By the grace of God I am what I am</hi> (<hi>viz.</hi> a Saint, an Apoſtle, who was before a Perſecutor) 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.10. He that ſeeth that there is ſome good thing in him towards the Lord, but yet more evil than good, more fleſh than ſpirit, more droſs than ſilver, more ſin than grace, hath no more cauſe to be proud of
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:45718:164"/>that little Grace and holineſs which he hath, than a man cauſe to be proud of beauty, who hath only a white hand, or a handſom leg, all the reſt of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy being ill favoured and deformed. If our ſins preponderate our graces (I mean, if they be more and greater than they (as in this life they alwaies are) if there be in us a more general indiſpoſedneſs, than there is promptneſs, and readineſs to what is good; more earthly than heavenly mindedneſs; more ſelf-ſeeking than ſelf-denyal; more bad thoughts than good; more unruly than well gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned deſires and affections (as who can ſay there is not) then have we more cauſe to be humble, than to be proud, yea to be humble and not proud. If that grace wherein we moſt excel (be it patience, or whatſoever elſe) be more deficient than it is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, more remote from perfection than it is near to it, then we who have but as it were <hi>put on our harneſs,</hi> have no cauſe to boaſt, which is for them only who have put it off. How imperfect are thoſe graces in which we are moſt defective, if that grace be ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective in which we are moſt perfect.</p>
            <p>Neither have we cauſe to be proud of what we have or poſſeſs, any more than of what we are, for if we might be proud of either, we might with more reaſon be proud of what we are than of what we have. (I mean of thoſe good things which are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in us (and are as it were part of our ſelves) than of thoſe which are without us. A good deſcent, a good eſtate, a good report, a great and good office, doth conſtitute no man good, that is poſſeſſed of any, or all of them (for a bad man may happen to have them all) and ſeeing ſuch things do not make, or deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate men good, they cannot redound ſo much to any mans praiſe as inward goodneſs doth, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no man can pretend ſo much reaſon to be
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:45718:165"/>proud of thoſe things; for it is leſs honourable to injoy what is good (which the worſt of men may do) than to be good our ſelves.</p>
            <p>He that is proud of what he hath, let me put the Apoſtles queſtion to him, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.7. <hi>Who maketh thee to differ from another? and what haſt thou, that thou didſt not receive? now if thou didſt receive it, why doſt thou glory, as if thou hadſt not received it?</hi> He that gave thee any good thing which thou injoyeſt, could have with-held it from thee, &amp; given it to him from whom it is with-held, <hi>Prov.</hi> 22.2. <hi>The rich and poor meet together, the Lord is the maker of them all.</hi> If thou art a rich man, he that made thee a man, made thee rich; and he that made thee rich, and thy neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour poor, could (and yet can) have made thee poor and him rich.</p>
            <p>I ſuppoſe thou haſt received evil things from the hands of God, as well as good; the evil thou haſt received was deſerved, ſo was not the good, why then ſhould undeſerved good make thee proud, and not deſerved evil rather keep thee humble?</p>
            <p>Art thou proud of the good and worthy things which thou haſt done (in one kind and in another?) no reaſon for that, becauſe it was not thou that didſt them (as it is not the young ſcribler that writes a fair copy, but his maſter that guideth his hand,) but <hi>God who performeth all things for thee, heare</hi> S. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.10. <hi>I laboured more abundantly than they all (ſaith he) yet not I but the grace of God that was with me.</hi> And Phil. 2.13. <hi>It is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleaſure.</hi> If we inſtance but in temporal things, ſee <hi>Deut.</hi> 8.18. <hi>The Lord thy God, it is he that giveth thee power to get wealth.</hi> If thy good deeds (which yet are not properly thine) be apt to lift thee up, think of thy evil do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and of thy wayes which have not been good.
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:45718:165"/>Thy good deeds, may be like the baſons and ewers which are ſometimes drawn in lotteries, but very ſew of them, but they evil ones like the ſmall plate, or rather like the meer blanks there drawn, which are far the greater number. Some hours thou haſt ſpent well, but how many more haſt thou miſpent? ſome warm and affectionate prayers thou haſt poured out to God, but how many more that were cold and heartleſs? ſet one againſt the other and ſee how little cauſe thou haſt to be proud? any more than a miſer of his liberality, who makes a great feaſt, but once, or twice a year; and pinch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his family all the time beſides. Think but of the good thou haſt left undone (that is, which thou mighteſt have done and haſt not) and then (if thou canſt) be proud of the good which thou haſt done; or ſhew cauſe why thou ſhouldſt be ſo. Some good thou haſt done with thy time, parts, eſtate, pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But poſſibly thou couldſt have done ten times more, if thy heart had ſerv'd thee: Is not then boaſting excluded? if thou haſt done but the tithe of that good which thou hadſt power to do, whoſe evil deeds beſides are like the ſtars of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, which cannot be numbred.</p>
            <p>Neither haſt thou juſt cauſe to boaſt of thy ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, if thou haſt been a great ſufferer even for righteouſneſs ſake, conſidering firſt, what the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſpeaketh, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.29. <hi>To you it is given in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of Chriſt not only to believe on him, but alſo to ſuffer for his ſake.</hi> We ſhould not take the honour of our ſufferings to our ſelves, or be proud thereof, fith God hath given us the grace whereby we ſuffer. It is he that hath made us ſufferers for his name ſake. (I mean willing to be ſuch) and not we our ſelves. We ſhould never have been called to honor God by ſuffering (any more than glorious Saints and
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:45718:166"/>Angels) had we not diſhonoured him by ſinning. What any of us ſuffer for Chriſt, is no ways com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable to what he hath ſuffered for us, nay it is far ſhort of what we have ſuffered for ſin, or upon the account of ſin; for upon that accompt are all, or the moſt of our other ſufferings, and afflictions which are generally more than thoſe, that go by the name of perſecutions, what we ſuffer for the truth is uſually much leſs than what the truth hath ſuffered by us: <hi>viz.</hi> by our uneven, and uncircumſpect walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; ſo that our ſufferings may be lookt upon as meer reſtitution made to the truth, and that but in part. All which things conſidered, I ſee no cauſe any man hath to be proud of his ſufferings, and if not of what he hath ſuffered, nor of what he hath done, nor of what he hath, nor of what he is (as I have proved particularly) then no man hath cauſe to be proud of any thing whatſoever.</p>
            <p>Admit then a man ſhould take himſelf to be much better than he is, every way better, yet from thence no juſt cauſe would be miniſtred to him, to ſacrifice to his own net (which all proud men do) Sith the beſt man in the world is indebted to God, for all that good which he either is, or hath, or hath done, or hath ſuffered; and it is thought an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable thing for a man to be proud of his debts eſpecially when he hath not wherewithall to make ſatisfaction.</p>
            <p>Having then proved that every man hath great cauſe to be humble, and no man hath any cauſe to be proud from thoſe premiſes, I draw this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, <hi>viz.</hi> That he who thinks ſoberly of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and not more highly than he ought to think, muſt needs be an humble perſon, and that the <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malis ratio,</hi> or eſſence of humility doth conſiſt in knowing, and owning our ſelves to be as mean,
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:45718:166"/>vile, and unworthy as indeed we are; and that from that fountain do iſſue all thoſe ſtreams, which are commonly, and properly counted the expreſſions of Humility.</p>
            <p>I may but aſſign the reaſons why God may build a City for thoſe that are humble, rather than for thoſe that are proud, and ſo paſs on to another Chapter. It may well be expected that God ſhould do more for thoſe whom he loves, than for thoſe whom he hates. Now the text ſaith, <hi>Every one that is proud in heart, is an abomination to the Lord,</hi> Prov. 16.5. and Prov. 8.15. <hi>Pride and arrogancy do I hate: Six things doth the Lord hate, yea, ſeven are an abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to him,</hi> and the firſt of them is <hi>a proud look.</hi> God hath put a ſtrang enmity into men againſt the ſin of pride, ſo far as it diſcovers it ſelf in others, in ſo much that the real worth, of a proud perſon is ſeldom owned, and others do what they can to eclipſe him, juſt as neighbouring Princes do to weaken any Kingdom or State that grows too great, and threatens to overtop them. Some bigger ſtars to us appear leſs becauſe of their great height and diſtance from us, and thoſe that are leſs than they (as the Moon for one) to us appear bigger becauſe they are lower ſeated, and come nearer to us. The proud perſon is as the former, who keeping too great a diſtance from others, is leſs accounted of, and the humble perſon as the latter, who ſhineth more with the raies of other mens commendation, than a proud man that hath more brightneſs of his own.</p>
            <p>Many kinds of ſinners do love one another, as ſuch, <hi>viz.</hi> Fellow-drunkards, fellow-gameſters, fellow-whoremaſters; but proud perſons are great haters of their own order: I mean one of another, all hate pride in others, but none hate it ſo much, as
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:45718:167"/>they that have moſt in themſelves. We have heard of <hi>the family of love,</hi> (a ſect ſo called) but proud perſons may go by the name of <hi>the family of hatred,</hi> God having ſignified his hatred to them by leaving them above all other ſorts of men to hate one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Proud men (ſo far as ſuch) will not ſuffer God to dwell with them, and in them; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore may not preſume that God will as much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern himſelf for them, and for their dwellings, as for thoſe who invite God to dwell in them, (for ſo by their humility they do) and in whom God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf delights to dwell. Two texts will fully prove the ſeveral branches of this ſecond reaſon, <hi>viz.</hi> Pſ. 10.3. <hi>The wicked through the pride of his countenance will not ſeek after God: God is not in all his thoughts.</hi> Therefore I ſay proud perſons will not let God dwell with them. But as to others God ſaith, <hi>I dwell with him that is of an humble ſpirit, to revive the ſpirit of the humble,</hi> Iſa. 57.15. God will provide dwellings for them, with whom himſelf delights to dwell, whilſt others it may be ſhall go without.</p>
            <p>God knows how little thanks himſelf ſhall have for building a City, or any thing elſe he ſhall do, for proud perſons who will certainly overlook his hand, and power, and goodneſs, and aſcribe all to their own, <hi>Deut.</hi> 8.12, 14, 17. <hi>Beware leaſt when thou art full, and haſt built goodly houſes, and dwelt therein, then thy heart be lifted up, and thou forget the Lord thy God, and thou ſay in thine heart my power, and the might of mine hand hath given me this wealth.</hi> When their hearts were lifted up, then were they in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to overlook the power of God; and ſurely his goodneſs no leſs, for what the Jews ſaid to Chriſt touching the Centurion, <hi>viz. That he was worthy for whom he ſhould do this,</hi> ſo proud perſons are apt to think that they themſelves are worthy of all that is
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:45718:167"/>done for them, either by God, or men; and who will be ſo thankful for what he takes as a due, as for what he takes as a curteſy, and meer benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence?</p>
            <p>To do great things for proud men (as to build a City for them) were to increaſe their pride, and to make them greater in their own eyes who are too great already, therefore the text ſaith, <hi>Beware leaſt when thou haſt built</hi> goodly houſes and dwelt in them, <hi>thine heart be lifted up,</hi> Deut. 8. When God hath made men humble, then (and not till then) he hath had his deſign in ruining them; and therefore then it may be hoped he will go about to reſtore them, <hi>Deut.</hi> 8.15. <hi>Who led thee through the great and terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble wilderneſs, that he might humble thee and do thee good at thy latter end,</hi> (but firſt humble thee.)</p>
            <p>What ſhould proud men do with goodly Cities? ſet them on fire with contention (for of pride commeth contention) and make them leſs deſira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble than a wilderneſs? as <hi>Solomon,</hi> Prov. 21.9. <hi>It is better to dwell, in a corner of the houſe top, than with a brawling woman in a wide houſe.</hi> Both from the promiſes and threatnings of God, may humble men collect, that they ſhall fare better than thoſe that are proud. The threatning ſaith, that <hi>God reſiſteth the proud,</hi> and he whom God reſiſteth is but in an ill caſe, and unlike to proſper: God ſeems to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in croſſing, and carrying headlong the deſigns of proud perſons, as of thoſe that went about to build the tower of <hi>Babel,</hi> of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and of <hi>Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezar:</hi> and it is the temper of not a few men and women to love to croſs and ſet themſelves againſt thoſe perſons, whom they judg exceeding proud.</p>
            <p>The word of promiſe is that <hi>the meek ſhall inherit the earth:</hi> and therefore they have moſt reaſon to
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:45718:168"/>expect that God will build a City for them, and for their ſakes. Why ſhould proud men be more adorned? they make too great a ſhew already, and are like meat that is ſtuck with many ſcuers, fairer to the eye, but worſe for ſpending, and moſt apt to be fly-blown.</p>
            <p>Pride, and ſelf confidence, or confidence in thoſe things which men are proud of) uſually go together. Therefore the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Charg them that are rich in this world, that they be not high minded, nor truſt in uncertain riches:</hi> and <hi>Solomon</hi> warns men <hi>not to lean to their own underſtanding</hi> (viz. Such as are apt to be proud thereof) now God delights to fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate the deſigns, and enterpriſes of thoſe perſons who truſt in themſelves, or in any other creature, and to ſhew them the weakneſs of an arm of fleſh, Jer. 17.5. <hi>Curſed be the man that truſteth in man, and maketh fleſh his arm, for he ſhall be like the heath in the deſert, and ſhall not ſee when good cometh, but ſhall inhabit the parched places in the wilderneſs, in a ſalt land and not inhabited.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Proud men are apt to affront God, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is not to be wondred at, that God ſhould not do as much for them, as for thoſe that are humble: <hi>Give me not riches</hi> (ſaid <hi>Agur</hi>) <hi>leaſt I be ful and deny thee, and ſay who is the Lord? Prov.</hi> 30.4. How can men affront God more, than in ſaying who is the Lord? and ſo ſaid <hi>Pharaoh</hi> in the pride of his heart, <hi>who is the Lord that I ſhould obey him?</hi> Proud men muſt be croſſed, and fruſtrated, leaſt they ſhould think themſelves to be more than men, Pſ. 9.20. <hi>Put them in fear O Lord, that the nations may know themſelves to be but men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Conſidering then how many wayes God is obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged (as it were) to reſiſt thoſe that are proud, them and their deſigns, and how he hath obliged himſelf

               </gap>urning of ſuch a City as <hi>London</hi> was, himſelf being greatly concerned in it. Till God have made us kiſs his rod, and ſo far forth accept the puniſhment of our iniquity as to acknowledg that he was righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in burning ſo great a part of our City, and had been ſo if he had burnt it all; and would be ſo if he ſhould never ſuffer it to be built again, and till he have made us ſee, that <hi>except the Lord-build the houſe</hi> and ſo the City, <hi>they labour in vain that build it, Pſal.</hi> 127.1. That it is impoſſible for us by our own power and ſtrength, to build us another City; unleſs he who is <hi>the maker and builder of all things,</hi> ſhall conſent to and concur in it: I ſay till God have ſo far humbled us, though we may build through his permiſſion, we ſhall not build with his bleſſing, and if we continue in the hateful ſin of pride, he can give us a City in his wrath, and take it away again in his wrath.</p>
            <p>As therefore our City goes up, let our pride go down. It is too much for ſuch worthleſs creatures as we all are to think our ſelves to be any thing, but as God influenceth and inſpireth us (as a Trumpet can give no ſound, but as the trumpiter breaths into it) and therefore he ſaid well, who ſaid, that

               <hi>no man is any thing more</hi> (meaning that good is) <hi>than what God makes him daily and hourly.

It is a very ſignificant phraſe both in our native tongue, that when we would ſay a man is proud, we ſay <hi>he thinks himſelf to be ſome body,</hi> as if every man were nothing, and thoſe words were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicable to every proud man, <hi>he that thinks himſelf to be ſomething, when he is nothing, deceiveth himſelf, Gal.</hi> 6.3. I find the ſame phraſe in the Greek Teſtament, for we read of <hi>Theudas</hi> boaſting himſelf to be <hi>ſome body</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.

                  <hi>That to ſeek the Kingdom of God, and the righteouſneſs thereof, in the firſt place (for Londoners generally ſo to do) were one of the beſt ways to obtain a new City.</hi>
               </p>
            </argument>
            <p>HE that reads the title of this Chapter will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently reflect upon, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.33. <hi>But ſeek ye firſt the Kingdom of God and his righteouſneſs and all theſe things ſhall be added to you,</hi> and in reflecting upon thoſe words, will ſee a plain proof of that propoſition, whereof the title doth conſiſt, taking it for granted that though meat, and drink, and cloathing, be the only things expreſſed in that place, of which it is ſaid they ſhall be added to them, that ſeek the kingdom God, yet all other needful things for this life, are there implied, and intended, as by a parity of reaſon (which is a good ſort of argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) may be concluded. The foregoing words are, <hi>your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all theſe things,</hi> v. 32. From whence we may infer, that all ſuch things as our heavenly Father knows we have need, or neceſſity of in this life, ſhall be added to them who ſeek his Kingdom in the firſt place.</p>
            <p>Our ultimate, or laſt end, (ſo far as we foreſee it our ſelves) is always firſt thought of; it is firſt in intention, though it be laſt in execution. We think of the end of our journey (or that which for
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:45718:170"/>the preſent, we intend ſhall be ſo) before we ſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> out, or enterprize the beginning thereof. In this ſenſe ought the Kingdom of God and the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs thereof to be ſought by us in the firſt place, that is, to be made our higheſt end, our ultimate deſign, to which all other deſigns are to be refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and ſubordinated, as for example: If your ends and aims be regular they are in this order: you would have a City that you might buy and ſell, and get gain (that is the loweſt round of the lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der) you would do that, that you and yours might live, and comfortably ſubſiſt, you would have a comfortable ſubſiſtence that you might attend upon God, without diſtraction, and ſerve him with chearfulneſs in the midſt of all the good things which he ſhall give you to injoy: and you would ſerve God on earth, <hi>in righteouſneſs and holineſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him,</hi> that you might for ever injoy him in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and arrive to that glorious Kingdom, which he hath provided for them that love and ſerve him. This is your higheſt end, and thus doing, thus aim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, you ſeek the Kingdom of God in the firſt place. For though that end be the laſt thing in order of time, and of attainment yet it is firſt in order of nature, for all cauſes are before their effects, now ends are cauſes, (as the final cauſe is often ſpoken of) and the higheſt ends of any action is the firſt cauſe thereof, that is, within our ſelves, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently it is the firſt thing that is in our thoughts, it is the firſt mover, the great wheel or ſpring that ſets all the reſt a going.</p>
            <p>Now I ſay, in this manner to ſeek the kingdom of God, and the righteouſneſs of it, if that were generally done by thoſe that are concerned in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> would make that deſolate City to ſpring up <hi>as tender graſs ſpringing out of the earth, by clear
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:45718:170"/>ſhining after rain,</hi> and cauſe the bleſſing of God to come down upon it, <hi>like rain upon the women graſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Religion (all things conſidered) was never a hinderance to any great and worthy undertaking, but always a help and furtherance. The propheſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Haggai,</hi> and <hi>Zechariah</hi> (as I ſhewed before) made the building of the Temple to proſper. A religious <hi>ſtanding ſtill</hi> (to allude to thoſe words of <hi>Moſes,</hi> Exod. 14.13. <hi>ſtand ſtill and ſee the ſalvation of the Lord</hi>) Will make the City go forward, when a prophane activity would but hinder it. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the City ſhould require ſeven years time to build it again, ſome may think that doing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to it upon the Sabbath day, is a great hinderance, and would be the loſs, of no leſs than one whole year in ſeven, but if we conſider the curſe which it prevents, and the bleſſing which it procureth, it will be found to be no loſs at all, and that the City in effect, and in due conſtruction, goes up as faſt or faſter on the Sabbath-day, than on any day in the week. Whilſt we are ſeeking Gods Kingdom, and the righteouſneſs thereof, God (though in an inviſible way) is adding to us, <hi>Jer.</hi> 17.24. <hi>It ſhall come to paſs if ye hallow the Sabbath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, to do no work therein, then ſhall there enter into the gate of this City, Kings and Princes, and the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of Jeruſalem, and this City ſhall remain for ever.</hi> God who had ſet apart a tenth for his own uſe, gave the <hi>Jews</hi> aſſurance they ſhould be nothing the poorer, but much the richer for paying of it, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.10. <hi>Bring ye all the tithes into the ſtore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe that there may be meat in my houſe, and prove me now herewith ſaith the Lord of Hoſts, if I will not open the windows of Heaven, and pour you out a bleſſing, that there ſhall not be room enough to receive it.</hi> The <hi>Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites</hi>
               <pb n="314" facs="tcp:45718:171"/>when they were before <hi>Jericho,</hi> beſieging it, loſt no time by carrying about the Ark, and ſounding the Trumpets as was appointed them, for it is ſaid, <hi>It ſhall come to paſs when ye hear the ſound of the Trumpet, all the people ſhall ſhout with a great ſhout, and the wall of the City, ſhall fall down flat,</hi> Joſhua 6.5. The Prophet was angry with the King of <hi>Iſrael</hi> for ſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ground but thrice, 2 <hi>Kings.</hi> 13.19. <hi>Thou ſhouldſt have ſmitten five or ſix times (ſaid he) then hadſt thou ſmitten Syria, till thou hadſt conſumed it: whereas now thou ſhalt ſmite Syria but thrice.</hi> Alluding to that ſtory, I would ſay, if we ſmote the ground oftner, if we were more clothed with the Sun, and did more frequently trample the earth under our feet, my meaning is, if we were more abundant in the duties, and exerciſes of Religion, than moſt of us are, it would be no hindrance to our worldly concerns, and particularly to that of building our City, but rather a help and furtherance.</p>
            <p>The practiſe of Religion, both in refraining what is evil, and doing what is good, is never more ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary than when ſome great undertaking is in hand, <hi>Deut.</hi> 23.9. <hi>When the hoſt goes forth againſt thine enemies then keep thee from every wicked thing;</hi> and are we not as much concerned ſo to do, when we have a City to build, as at this day. Our way to have another City even upon earth, is to imitate thoſe worthies we read of, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.16. <hi>But now they deſire a better country, that is, an heavenly: wherefore God is not aſhamed to be called their God: for he hath prepared for them a City.</hi>

            <p>When <hi>Saul</hi> went to ſeek his Fathers Aſſes, he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expectedly found a Kingdom, but it is to be feared that many will loſe a Kingdom, whilſt they ſeek for Aſſes, I mean for poor trifles, an earthly houſe, or City, which are no better, in compariſon of a
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:45718:171"/>heavenly Kingdom. It is incident to us to invert Gods method, we would ſeek other things either in the firſt place, or altogether, and have the Kingdom of God added to us, we would ſeek earth, and find Heaven, but God will not alter his method, and men by going about to do it, do indanger the loſs, of Heaven, and earth both, both of their intereſt, (if I may ſo call the world which they live upon for the preſent) and of their <hi>principal</hi> which they expect hereafter.</p>
            <p>How unreaſonable a preſumption is it that God ſhould mind our concerns, and we not mind his? that God ſhould regard our houſes, if we will not regard his Kingdom, the beginning, increaſe, and perfecting thereof, both in our ſelves and others? By the Kingdom of God, I mean the Kingdom of Grace which is glory begun, and the kingdom of glory which is grace perfected. Which being but gradually diſtinct, (as the ſame perſon in infancy and at full age) I may ſpeak of as one kingdom, (<hi>viz.</hi> ſpecifically ſo, I ſpeak of that kingdom as Gods concern, becauſe his glory is as truly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in it, as our good, his honor as our happineſs, And thence it is that they who refuſe to be ſubjects of that kingdom, are ſo ſeverely threatned. <hi>Thoſe mine enemies who would not that I ſhould raign over them, bring them hither and ſlay them before me.</hi> It is ſaid of the Hebrew Midwives, that <hi>becauſe they feared God he made them houſes,</hi> Exod. 1.21. But will God build houſes and Cities for them that fear him not, yea for his enemies whom he hath threatned to ſlay? at leaſtwiſe can they promiſe themſelves he will do ſo? or hath he any where promiſed ſo to do? nay in <hi>Prov.</hi> 14.11. it is ſaid <hi>The houſe of the wicked ſhall be overthrown, but the tabernacle of the righteous ſhall flouriſh.</hi>

            <p>But ere I proceed in ſpeaking to men, let me ſpeak a few words to God, on behalf of my ſelf and others, Lord give me more faith in this promiſe, this double promiſe, (for ſo I underſtand it) that they who ſeek thy Kingdom, and the righteouſneſs thereof, in the firſt place ſhall have it, and all other needful things with it, for ſo the phraſe of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, or ſuperadding ſeemeth to imply. And Lord give the ſame faith to others, for hundreds need it at this day, who till of late never knew they needed it, or went about to make experiment of it. O Lord! how fearful are moſt men to ſwim, when they are above their depth? when they can feel no ground, under them, that meer ſenſe and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon can ſtand upon. We would fain be always in thoſe ſhallows where lambs may wade, but never caſt into thoſe depths, where <hi>Elephants</hi> muſt ſwim, but thou Lord doſt ſometimes try us with the latter of thoſe; give us but faith enough in that conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal promiſe, that they who ſeek thy kingdom, &amp;c. ſhall have all things added, and together with that faith, give us but the condition of that promiſe, <hi>viz.</hi> hearts to ſeek thy kingdom, as we ought to ſeek it, and having thoſe two, we ſhall not doubt but to arrive at whatſoever is, and ſhall be neceſſary, both for the life that is, and that which is to come!</p>
            <p>To me it ſeemeth a little ſtrang, that the great God having made the promiſe of a Kingdom to
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:45718:172"/>ſuch as ſeek it in the firſt place (<hi>and by patient con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance in well doing,</hi> for that I muſt adde out of <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.) Should adde any promiſe of things ſo much inferiour to it, as are the good things of this life, the giving whereof might ſo eaſily have been inferred, and concluded from the promiſe of that kingdom, with a <hi>quanto magis,</hi> as the Apoſtle in another caſe, <hi>If when we were enemies, we were recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to God by the death of his Son, much more being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled, we ſhall be ſaved by his life,</hi> Rom. 5.10. He that hath aſſured us of an heavenly kingdom, if we ſeek it, and the righteouſneſs thereof, will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly in that caſe, not deny us an earthly City, or any thing of that nature, ſeeing it to be good for us. But as young Virgins can hardly perſwade them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves their ſuitors do love them, unleſs they ever and anon, preſent them with one thing or another, that might be ſpared, over and above the ſolid offers they make of ſetling great and liberal joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures upon them: So the great God by way of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcention to our (weakneſs, knowing us to be much what of the ſame temper,) hath promiſed us the little things of this life, (for ſo they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratively) over and above his kingdom, if we will but ſeek his kingdom, and the righteouſneſs thereof in the firſt place.</p>
            <p>It is too apparent that the generality of men have a jealouſy they ſhall loſe other things, whilſt they ſeek the kingdom of God, and the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs thereof: therefore when men have any great and important work in hand, the generality do bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row more time from religion, for and towards it than from any thing elſe (I mean proportionably to the time they had wont to ſpend in it) <hi>ex. gr.</hi> when they have building work in hand, poſſibly they will pray but half ſo long, or ſo often, read but
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:45718:173"/>half ſo much, meditate of good things but a fourth part ſo much, as at other times; ſo that the great tax towards ſuch occaſions lieth generally upon Religion, as if that could beſt admit of a <hi>defalcation</hi> of any thing elſe, for few men content themſelves with but half ſo much ſleep, half ſo much recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as they had wont to uſe at other times. But ſay I, never pinch thy general calling to promote thy particular calling, but rather hope to promote thy particular calling, by giving full ſcope to thy ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, for in this as in other ſenſes, <hi>the leſſe is bleſſed of the greater.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Borrow time for thy building from thy reſt or recreation, not from thy devotion: Prayer and other duties are a help to building, but ſo is not ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous ſleep, or needleſs recreation. Don't build firſt and pray afterwards, but pray firſt from day to day, and fall to building afterwards, neither ask the firſt bleſſing upon thy temporal building, be it an houſe or City, but upon the building up of thy Soul in thy moſt holy faith: Firſt that thy Soul may proſper, and be <hi>a habitation for God through his ſpirit,</hi> and after that thy houſe. It was a bitter <hi>Irony</hi> of him that ſaid, <hi>O cives, cives, querenda pecunia primum eſt, virtus poſt nummos!</hi> that is, that the Citizens of his time ſought money in the firſt place, and virtue afterwards.</p>
            <p>The kingdom of God, at this day, I mean the ſtate of religion in the world, and in the hearts of moſt profeſſors, is much what in ſuch a condition as is the City of <hi>London,</hi> viz. low and ruinous, and very imperfect to what it ſhall be when <hi>the ſeventh Angel ſhall ſound, ſaying the kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Chriſt,</hi> Rev. 11.15.

            </argument>
            <p>IT is an ill wind (ſaith our proverb) that bloweth no body good. Artificers who relate to build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing have, at this day, more work than they can turn their hands to. Surely <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaith true, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>Privation is a principle,</hi> and <hi>that the corruption or deſtruction of one thing is the generation or production of another.</hi> The burning of <hi>London</hi> hath made way for all or moſt, poor trades to live; but not for Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, they are the <hi>Camelions,</hi> that muſt live upon the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>aire (if they know how) unleſs they can be <hi>Came<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions</hi> in another ſenſe, <hi>viz.</hi> aſſume the colour of all things which they come near. Water-men tell us they can earn twenty ſhillings a week with eaſe, (if they be good husbands,) that many excellent ſcholars cannot do, nor half ſo much, though they ply their learned oars ever ſo hard. They are the only men, who under ſeveral revolutions have bin forced to ſtand idle in the market place, for that none would hire them or ſet them at work.</p>
            <p>If poverty and neceſſity (that <hi>ingens telum</hi>) may be compared to Lions (as by the fright ſome have taken at the very roaring of them, at a great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, one would think they might) they and their families, have time after time been conſigned to
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:45718:174"/>the Lions Den, and <hi>erruditos</hi> inſtead of <hi>Chriſtianos ad Leones,</hi> that is, away with Scholars, as heretofore with Chriſtians to the Lions, hath bin the great out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cry under ſeveral changes. They have bin the only men, who did they live ever ſo ſoberly, peacably, piouſly, and might they have lived ever ſo uſefully, and for publick good, if not otherwiſe qualified, have not been thought worthy to live. They might not eat, becauſe they might not work, nor might have leave to work leaſt they ſhould eat. They might not <hi>tread out the corn,</hi> becauſe if they did do ſo, their mouths muſt be unmuzled, and they have leave to feed. It was no matter what their talents were (though the talents of a <hi>Holdſworth</hi> a <hi>Featly,</hi> &amp;c.) Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents of lead will give ſome men as good content (if not better) than talents of gold. The world hath thought that Scholars pains might beſt be ſpared, which is ſuch a paradox, as if they ſhould tell us that Souls are leſs worth than any thing elſe, which Chriſt tells us are more worth than the whole world, for ſaith he <hi>what ſhall it profit a man, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is incredible what ſhifts Scholars, under ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral changes, have been put to: one while be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they would not take the <hi>Ingagement,</hi> forſooth, out they muſt. Let it be no more a proverb, that <hi>Quaevis terra alit artes,</hi> that is, <hi>every country cheriſheth learning,</hi> for there is no truth in it. <hi>Muſculus</hi> was an excellent Scholar, and yet forced to dig in the town ditch, as ſome others of his profeſſion have bin in Cole-pits, and Tin-mines. Alas, how many Schollars have bin tempted to wiſh themſelves poor mechanicks, or handicrafts-men; and that when their parents ſent them to the Univerſity, they had bound them to ſome ſorry trade, by which they might have been able to have got their bread, and to have lived like themſelves.</p>
            <pb n="321" facs="tcp:45718:174"/>
            <p>Surely Scholars would as fain live as other men, they love themſelves and their Families as well as others do, the light of learning in them, hath not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed the light of nature. If they have not li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved as well, and as plentifully as other men, it was becauſe they did not dare to do ſo, or as <hi>Nehemiah</hi> ſaid, <hi>So did not I, becauſe of the fear of God,</hi> Neh. 5.15.</p>
            <p>Three Apprentiſhips at the Univerſity, with three degrees on a mans back, well deſerved, have not turned to ſo good an account to many, as one Apprentiſhip to a mean Shop-keeper hath done to many others. Tradeſmen can live upon their Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, but Schollars have bin put to live upon their friends (if they had any). Many excellent Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars put out of the way of Learning, know not how to earn a penny (as they ſay) if their lives did depend upon it. In times of many Revolutions, Schollars are of all men moſt miſerable, unleſs they be men of ſuch volatile wits, that they can turn every way, unleſs they be perfect weather-cocks, or unleſs together <hi>with their wiſdome they have an Inheritance.</hi> It is expected that Schollars ſhould be <hi>Commonwealths<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, Protectorians, Presbyterians, Independants,</hi> and every thing elſe that is uppermoſt, and the way of their times, as if in that ſenſe it were true, <hi>That eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing is good in its ſeaſon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A Schollar muſt be every thing ſucceſſively, or he muſt be nothing, or rather no-body. He muſt change his ſhape as oft as doth the Silk-worm, if he would be clad as he is, that is, clothed with ſoft, and coſtly raiment. He muſt be like a <hi>door turning upon the hinges,</hi> that is, this way, and the other way, if he will come to any thing, though that be the compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that <hi>Solomon</hi> uſeth for a ſluggard. He muſt ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be <hi>materia prima,</hi> or he muſt be reduced to it;
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:45718:175"/>that is, either ſuſceptible of all forms, or ſtript of all enjoyments. I write not this to blame the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy or reaſon of ſtate that hath thought fit it ſhould be ſo, (though he that will, may cenſure thoſe times whence I have taken the inſtances of this kind of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity) but to condole the miſery of Schollars in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard it hath bin ſo.</p>
            <p>Many do diſtruſt that ſaying which hath bin apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to learning, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>Emollit mores nec ſinit eſſe feros:</hi> that is, that it ſoftens the manners of men, and ſuffers them not to be fierce. For who have bin more profound to deſtroy one another than Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars? If <hi>homo homini lupus</hi> be a Proverb, it hath bin no where more verified than amongſt Schollars, who have bin <hi>lupi in fabula</hi> one to another, and devoured one anothers maintenance, and livelyhoods, by the impoſition of <hi>Ingagements,</hi> and ſuch like Artifices, inſtructing after-times in methods of policy, which the depraved nature of man is but too prone to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. Hath it ſignified any thing to a livelyhood in ſome times and places, for a Schollar to be excellent at his Profeſſion, and very vertuous beſides? if weighed in other ſcales, he hath bin found too light, his little kingdom, I mean his work and wages have both bin taken from him. He that would not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for his Family by going beyond the line of his Principles (if diſſenting) hath bin ſo dealt with, as if he had bin <hi>worſe than an infidel, and had denyed the Faith.</hi> For whilſt <hi>Jews</hi> and other Infidels have bin permitted to live, and provide for their Families, ſo might not he. <hi>He is a Cavalier, an Epiſcopal man, or, &amp;c.

            <p>Why doth our Mother, the Univerſity, put ſuch reſpect upon her ſons, that are Fellows of Colled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges? why will ſhe have them capt as far as they can be diſcerned? are they there lifted up that they may take the greater fall? <hi>(Tolluntur in altum, ut lapſu graviore ruant.)</hi> Are they there ſo honoured, that they may be elſwhere more deſpicable? there they ſit with the ſons of Nobles, but how ſoon do

            </p>
            <p>Some Schollars that have had excellent Libraries, could neither ſell their books without great loſs, nor keep them without great vanity. For what ſhould they do with books that can make no uſe of their learning? any more than a Muſician with a great many Lutes and Viols, who is not permitted to play one Leſſon upon any of them? Some have even idolized their Books, their Books have bin as it were their God, and yet thoſe very perſons have bin forced to an unhappy Tranſubſtantiation, <hi>viz.</hi> to turn that their God into bread.</p>
            <p>If Schollars continue Batchelors, (as few of them do in that ſenſe) <hi>make themſelves Eunuchs for the Kingdom of Heavens ſake</hi> (alluding to <hi>Mat.</hi> 19.12.) poſſibly they may be received into ſome good Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, and be there entertained, ſo as the Prophet was by the <hi>Shunamite,</hi> 2 Kings 4.10. <hi>Let us make a little Chamber in the Wall, and let us ſet for him there, a bed, and a Table, and a stool, and a Candlestick, and it ſhall be when he commeth to us, he ſhall turn in thither.</hi> I can but think what hard ſhift the Sons of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets made in <hi>Eliſha's</hi> time, <hi>The place where we dwell, ſaid they to</hi> Eliſha, <hi>is too ſtrait for us, Let us go unto</hi> Jor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan, <hi>and take thence every man a beam, and let us make us a place where we may dwell.</hi> Surely it was but a ſorry houſe that thoſe young Prophets could build, and with no more materials than every man his beam; it ſeemeth to have bin no other than a Booth, or Bower, or Tent, built by the water ſide; yet that was as good a dwelling as the Sons or Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pils of the Prophets did at that time expect.</p>
            <p>But if Schollars happen to marry (as moſt of them do) and after they have ſo done, come to have their

Schollars, though the Fathers of many ſweet children, do often lye at their mercy who were never Fathers themſelves, and therefore know not what the heart, or care of a Father doth mean!</p>
            <p>When ever it is ſo that the condition of Schollars is ſo deplorable, I know no remedy in the caſe, but Prayers and tears, Faith and patience in the uſe of humble perſwaſions, and petitionings, and if they will not prevail, each of them muſt ſit down and ſay as did the Prophet <hi>Jerem.</hi> 10.19. <hi>Wo is me for my hurt, my wound is grievous. Truly this is a grief, and I muſt bear it.</hi> Surely when God ſhall do good in his good pleaſure to <hi>Sion,</hi> and build the Walls of <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi> then all ſuch workmen as need not to be aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, ſhall be employed and encouraged: Mean time <hi>let Patience have her perfect work, that ye may be perfect and entire, wanting nothing</hi> (even whilſt you
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:45718:177"/>ſeem to want every thing), <hi>James</hi> 1.4.</p>
            <p>May it not conſiſt with patience for Scholars to give their grief ſome modeſt vent, to prevent the breaking of their hearts, and that <hi>looſers take leave to ſpeak,</hi> which our proverb ſaith ſhould be given them: then we will proceed a little. Scholars muſt not be pitied becauſe having wit, and learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, it is ſuppoſed they can ſhift, (though indeed none are more ſhiftleſs for the world than they) none more like to ſheep than they, of which it is reported, that if they have once loſt their ways, they can never find it again. Scholars under hatches, muſt keep a perpetual faſt, or at leaſtwiſe <hi>disfigure their faces,</hi> as if they did do ſo, or elſe it will be taken for granted, that becauſe they ſmile upon the world, the world doth not frown upon them. Scholars muſt generally live either in the torrid zone of a polemical zeal, I mean a zeal for polemical, and diſputable matters (which the light and temper, and ingenuity of ſome men, will not permit them to do) or elſe they muſt live in the frigid zone of a cold, and almoſt ſtarving charity.</p>
            <p>If Scholars be not honeſt, and conſcientious, it is not fit they ſhould be Miniſters, and if they be conſcientious, they run a great adventure? For was it not one while contriving (and who can ſecure after ages from the like ſnares) that Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars ſhall be put to abjure that family, and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to which the body of the nation had ſworn allegiance; as if they could do all things by an om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotency of diſtinctions, or as if they were never to be truſted, till they had taken <hi>Achitophels</hi> councel <hi>viz.</hi> to be with their Fathers Concubines, in the face of the Sun, I mean to do ſome horrid, and odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous thing.</p>
            <p>It is one of the unhappineſſes, of Scholars, that

            <p>Let Scholars live ſingle if they can, for if they have not the gift of <hi>continency,</hi> all their other gifts in point of livelihood, may amount to little.

            <p>Let as high aſſurances of peaceableneſs under the Government be given by Miniſters, as are required of Officers who have the greateſt Commands either at Sea or Land, and what is lookt upon as Security enough for a greater truſt, may in reaſon be thought not inſufficient for a leſs.</p>
            <p>When the work of Schollars is publick, and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſet as lights upon a Hill, their miſcarriages cannot be hid, and there will be many Witneſſes and Judges of what they ſay, and do amiſs.

It is hard for a Candle to ſhine under a Buſhel, and not burn the buſhel under which it ſhineth; but there is no danger of a Candle that ſhineth in an open place. If Schollars will abuſe that publick Liberty whereby they are enabled to live, and to do good to others, let their penalty be great: He deſerves no Pulpit that cannot uſe it peaceably, and without giving juſt offence. But on the other hand, let them Preach the Goſpel, and live upon the Goſpel, whoſe work it is (and whoſe character, for that
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:45718:181"/>work is ſaid to be indelible) if they will but ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage it as a Goſpel of peace, and as the <hi>Goſpel</hi> of mens <hi>Salvation.</hi>

            <p>Let not former Offences be remembred againſt Schollars, more than againſt other men, eſpecially thoſe of which themſelves were never perſonally guilty. If their Fathers (I mean perſons more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged and eminent than themſelves) are thought to <hi>have eaten ſowr Grapes, let not their teeth be ſet on edg,</hi> their bands made ſtronger, or their yoke made hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vier, becauſe of that, for that were to perpetuate wrong to the end of the world, and to make it boil higher and higher under every Change.</p>
            <p>It were no difficult matter to lay competent ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations upon all men of Learning and worth, (eſpecially ſuch whoſe expectations are not high, and who would be thankful for that which were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally but a competency) which being done, it would become their Intereſt to ſave that veſſel in which themſelves were Imbarqued, and to endeavor the Peace of them in <hi>whoſe Peace they</hi> themſelves <hi>ſhould have Peace,</hi> as it is <hi>Jer.</hi> 29.</p>
            <p>To ſecure themſelves againſt Learned men (or ſome of them) as real or ſuppoſed enemies, hath bin the trite Policy of every age, but to ſecure them to themſelves as cordial friends, and to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige them to be ſuch, were I think, a Policy beyond that; for then might they not only avoid the hurt, but receive all the good that all the Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned men of their time could do them.</p>

                  <hi>Of the rebuilding of Churches.</hi>
               </p>
            </argument>
            <p>HOw earneſtly were it to be wiſhed, that men, and women of Eſtates, would apply their charity to the building of Churches? Did I call it charity? ſurely that word is beneath the thing: for what is given to Gods uſe immediately, or to the uſe of his worſhip, and ſervice, is not <hi>Charity</hi> (ſtrictly ſo called) but <hi>Piety.</hi> Our <hi>charity</hi> extends not to God, but to the Saints that are upon the earth: for God receives no <hi>alms</hi> for his own uſe, but <hi>tribute,</hi> as do Princes. Yet I have let the word Charity ſlip, becauſe whatſoever is given without conſtraint, and of a willing mind, is vulgarly called by that name, (and <hi>loquendum cumvulgo</hi> is no ill rule) at leaſtwiſe when it is given to thoſe that want it: now though the great God do not want Churches, (<hi>Acts</hi> 17.25. <hi>God dwelleth not in Temples made with hands, neither is worſhipped with mens hands, as though he need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed any thing, ſeeing he giveth to all life, and all things.</hi>) Yet his ſervants do want them, yea and money too (many of them) wherewith to contribute any thing towards the building of them, and Churches are given as to God, in one ſenſe, <hi>viz.</hi> as places dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to his worſhip, ſo in another ſenſe to men, as good accommodations, and conveniences, for that publick worſhip which they ſhould tender un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God; now upon this latter account it is perfect <hi>charity</hi> to build Churches, though in reſpect of the former it was <hi>piety,</hi> now where piety and charity go hand in hand, where they greet and kiſs each other, they ſpeak the work excellent, in which they two concur, and give great hopes of good ſucceſs
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:45718:183"/>to them that ſhall take it in hand, as the appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of <hi>Caſtor</hi> and <hi>Pollux</hi> both at once, had wont to be conſtrued by Mariners as a good preſage of a proſperous voyage to inſue.</p>
            <p>As needful a work as I do apprehend it, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>build Churches, I would not ſay one word of it, if I did not think there were perſons enough in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> to bear the charg of it: and do themſelves no great hurt. There are, whoſe cups are full, and do overflow, who have enough, and to ſpare, <hi>who have more than heart can wiſh,</hi> that is, need to wiſh, for matter of eſtate, &amp;c. Many wealthy perſons have no heirs of their own bodies, nor can expect any, nor kindred it may be that are very near, and dear to them: others have heirs of their own bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, but not fit to be made heirs of their whole eſtates (or <hi>haeredes ex aſſe</hi>) becauſe they can expect no other, but that they will quickly run out all, and bring themſelves to husks, as did the prodigal, <hi>Luk.</hi> 15. Or as that great Lawyer propheſyed of his eldeſt ſon; to whom he ſaid in his laſt Will and Teſtament, that he left his eſtate to be ſcambled away, and imbezled, for he could hope no better. <hi>(neque enim de illo melius ſpero)</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Have ſuch perſons as theſe nothing to ſpare to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the rebuilding of Churches. If God had given them many children, (whom he hath been pleaſed to write childleſs) they could have given every child a fair portion, and made them all rich; and will not their hearts ſerve them to give the value of one childs portion, or of what they could have given to one, if they had had ſeven, or ten children (as they have none) towards building up convenient places for the worſhip of God? would ſuch a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion undo them? yea would they ſo much as feel it? what if the wealthy parents of hopeleſs
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:45718:183"/>children, did ſay to them as <hi>David</hi> ſaid to <hi>Mephibo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth? Thou and Zibah divide the inheritance,</hi> ſo in this caſe, thou and the deſolate Churches, and other pious uſes, ſhall even divide my eſtate betwixt you; ſurely in this caſe <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, that half is more than the whole, is as true as in any, <hi>viz.</hi> that half a fathers eſtate, is more to be given to a hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs child, than the whole of it, to one that is good and hopeful.</p>
            <p>Others (it may be) have a child or two not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hopeful, (but that is all they have) and the eſtate is ſo great as would have richly provided for many more; if ſuch ſhall pretend that they have nothing to ſpare to good uſes, neither would they have had, by the rule they go upon, if the whole world had bin theirs, for their rule is this, that whatſoever they have, be it ever ſo much they muſt leave it, intirely to their Children, be they ever ſo few: yea though they have but one, he or ſhe muſt have all, and by that means they load them with thick clay, till they break their backs again, they tempt ſome looſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to ſteal them, if they be daughters, or to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veagle them if they be ſons, they make them ſee ſo great an eſtate before them, that they think they ſhall never come to the end of it, they begin to think of dividing it, as the mother of <hi>Siſera</hi> and her wiſe ladies ſpake of his dividing the ſpoil, <hi>To every man a damſel or two</hi> (Judg. 5.30.) <hi>a prey of divers colours of needle work, on both ſides meet for the necks of them that take the ſpoil,</hi> I ſay they begin to think of dividing, or dedicating it, ſo much to <hi>Bacchus,</hi> and ſo much more to <hi>Venus,</hi> and ſo much to other heathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh Gods, and Goddeſſes of <hi>pleaſure.</hi> Thus ſome deſtroy their children as that <hi>Tarpeian</hi> Virgin was deſtroyed, by overwhelming them with <hi>bracelets,</hi> I mean with riches more than they know what to do withall.</p>
            <pb n="340" facs="tcp:45718:184"/>
            <p>Were it not better that ſome part of ſuch an eſtate were given to good uſes? went to build Churches? A private mans eſtate may be too great, as well as to little, as ſome Kingdoms have been, which have ſunk with their own weight <hi>(mole ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erunt ſua,)</hi> A ſhip may have too much ballaſt, as well as too little, and a boat may be overſet by too great a ſail. When thoſe that have more than enough for them and theirs, have ſo much wiſdom as to hear, and ſo much grace as to confeſs it, it will appear that <hi>England</hi> doth not want for money, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for the rebuilding of Churches. I doubt not but ſome who have but midling eſtates, and many Children will contribute freely to the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Churches, and ſhould not they much more who have great eſtates, and no great charg, but few children, or all bad, or none at all? If this be not a reaſonable motion (themſelves being Judges) let it be refuſed.</p>
            <p>Many are at great expences every year, upon things of far leſs conſequence than is the building of Churches: I would beg but a year or two's reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue, ſuch and ſo great, as ſome men ſpend upon their luſts, be they the luſts of the fleſh, or the pride of life, I ſay no more, as from them, for and towards the re-edifiing of demoliſhed Churches. Alas that men ſhould be more free, and bountiful to their ſins, than to their Souls, to works of darkneſs, than to works of piety, to damn their Souls, than to promote the means of ſaving them.</p>
            <p>Synagogues of State ſwarm every where, and are carefully provided for. There are Temples to <hi>Bac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus,</hi> and <hi>Venus</hi> almoſt innumerable, and much fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented. Men are about to build for themſelves better houſes than they had before, and while they they ſo do, would it not be a great ſhame if they
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:45718:184"/>ſhould build no houſe for God? muſt God be but as it were a ſojourner, whilſt we dwell in ceiled hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes? muſt the Ark remain as it were in tents? muſt religion be but <hi>a tenant at will</hi> having here and there a room afforded it, upon meer courteſy? There are (for ought I hear) but a moity of Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches to what were formerly intended to be built, though the inhabitants of <hi>London,</hi> are like to be as many as ever: if the piety of this time will not extend to that moity, it will be thought to be not half ſo much, as was the piety of former ages.</p>
            <p>How gladly would the <hi>Hugonites</hi> in <hi>France</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>build their Churches, which were wilfully pulled down; if they might have leave to do it? we have leave and incouragement, and ſhall we not build ours? How much more decent, how much more convenient, how much more publick, (generally) how much more unſuſpected, and unliable to ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, and exceptions from the world, is the exerciſe of religion in Churches than in private houſes? How did Infidels take occaſion (though moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly) by the primitive Chriſtians, their aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling in private, to charg thoſe horrid things upon them, which they could never have done, if they had met in publick? What religion is there in the world, that hath not publick temples erected for the exerciſe of it (whether <hi>Jewiſh,</hi> or <hi>Mahumetan,</hi> (if it be but permitted.)</p>
            <p>What noble Temples have been erected to idol Gods, <hi>which are no Gods,</hi> as that at <hi>Epheſus</hi> to <hi>Diana?</hi> It hath been a cuſtome amongſt the Jews to throw down the book of <hi>Eſther</hi> upon the ground, becauſe the name of God is not found in all that book: I do no more commend them for it, than <hi>Moſes</hi> for throwing down the two tables of the Law: but this I'le ſay, God may juſtly do ſo by <hi>London viz.</hi>
               <pb n="342" facs="tcp:45718:185"/>throw it to the ground again, if his name be not ſo far regarded, and recorded there, as by building up places for his publick worſhip.</p>

They will go nigh to ſay that proteſtants in <hi>England</hi> had never had any Churches worth the ſpeaking of, but that men of their religion built them. How kindly did God take it, that <hi>David</hi> did but purpoſe to build him a houſe (though he were prevented) and from <hi>Solomon</hi> that he did it? How great incouragements were given to building of the Temple, <hi>Haggai</hi> 1.4, 8. <hi>Build the houſe, and I will take pleaſure in it, and be glorified ſaith the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What if there were a more viſible preſence of God in the temple at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> where he dwelt in the thick cloud, and in many ſenſible tokens of his preſence? yet there is as real (though inviſible) yea ſometimes as comfortable a preſence of God in the places where his people now do or may
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:45718:185"/>aſſemble to worſhip him, and God in ſuch Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches as ours, is or may be ſerved in as pure ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, and in as acceptable a manner, as he had wont to be in the temple at <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There was indeed a ceremonial holineſs in that temple, and in the utenſils belonging to it, which is not in our Churches, and in the utenſils thereof, that is to ſay, that temple, and the apurtenances thereof, were ſo peculiarly, and intirely dedicated to God, and to his ſervice, that they could not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out prophaneſs be put to any other uſe, neither at one time nor at another. Therefore our Saviour whipt the buyers and ſellers out of the temple, tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling them it was <hi>a houſe of prayer,</hi> and we read of the <hi>ſhew-bread that it was not lawful for any to eat, but only for the Prieſts,</hi> Mat. 12.14. Doubtleſs <hi>Belſhaz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar,</hi> and his company, were profane in drinking their wine, out of the veſſels of the temple, <hi>Dan.</hi> 5.2. and that was counted as part of their ſin: but we challeng not to our Churches, and the utenſils thereof, ſuch a holineſs as this, <hi>viz.</hi> of being ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated to the uſe of Religion, and to no other uſe, at any time and upon any occaſion whatſoever, witneſs the liberty given in many parts of <hi>England,</hi> to teach ſchool in publick Churches, though con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated; implying that the exerciſe of that civil imployment there, is no ways oppoſite to that which is meant by the conſecration of Churches. Like inſtance might be given in the performance of academical exerciſes, ſuch as are making of ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, managing of philoſophical diſputes, not only in private Chappels, but in the moſt publick and eminent Churches, belonging to both our univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities. Now they that allow ſuch things, do thereby intimate that they attribute no ſuch ceremonial ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs to our Churches, as did belong to the temple
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:45718:186"/>at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> which to have ſo imployed had been great profaneneſs, but that they conceive that all civil, and ſecular uſes, and imployments are there, and then only, to be baniſhed from our Churches, when the ſervice of God is there celebrating, or to be celebrated. Juſt as we look upon the bread, and wine that is brought to the Communion Table, to be holy, only ſo far forth as it is made uſe of in, and for the purpoſe of the Lords Supper, and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the time of that adminiſtration, but when that is over, what remaineth may be uſed as common bread, ſopt into wine crum'd into milk, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe which may not be done to it, whilſt the Lords Supper is celebrating: ſo in this caſe, when, and ſo long, as there is any occaſion, or opportunity of religious ſervice to be performed in our Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, they muſt be wholly at the ſervice of Religion, and all things elſe muſt avoid, and give way: but when religion hath no preſent uſe, or occaſion for them, at all ſuch times, they may be for the uſe of thoſe civil, and ſecular affairs, which have need of them, and cannot be elſewhere ſo well accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated.</p>
            <p>This notion may (for ought I know) remove a ſtumbling block out of ſome mens way, which would have kept them from the contributing to the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Churches, as thinking that Churches, by vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of that which is called the conſecrating of them, were lookt upon to be as holy as ever the temple at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was, and in the ſame kind, <hi>viz.</hi> of <hi>cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial holineſs;</hi> whereas indeed there is no ſuch thing intended, as appeareth by the allowance gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to put them to common uſes, as to teach ſchool in them, &amp;c. but only as a religious man would dedicate his own houſe to God, as reſolving to ſerve, and worſhip God in it, though not to
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:45718:186"/>uſe it only for the purpoſes of Religion, ſo are Churches dedicated to the uſes of Religion, prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, and principally, and for as often as Religion hath occaſion for them, but ſo as not to be to thoſe purpoſes ſolely, and only to them, and to no other, in which peculiarity, and entireneſs of Dedication, did conſiſt that <hi>Ceremonial holineſs</hi> which was in the Temple of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> The places in which we wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip God, for, and during the time we are actually worſhipping, are, or ſhould be as holy as the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple was; that is to ſay, wholy devoted to the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God, and to no other uſe for that time (as I ſaid of the bread and wine in the Communion) though afterwards, they are free for other uſes. <hi>Melchiſedeck</hi> who was both King and Prieſt, was not the leſs holy as a Prieſt, becauſe he had alſo the ſecular employment of a King, neither are our Churches any wayes prophaned, by being ſomtimes put to uſes that are but civil, and not Sacred.</p>
            <p>Moral Holineſs there was none in the Temple of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> for places are not capable of ſuch holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs as perſons are, <hi>viz.</hi> that which conſiſts <hi>in genere morum,</hi> as in loving of God, and delighting in God, &amp;c. for that only reaſonable creatures are capable of: neither was there any intrinſecal and innate ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs in the Temple, ſuch as is in part of that which we call the Moral Law, which was good, and holy in it ſelf <hi>(quaedam Deus voluit quia in ſe bona)</hi> but the Temple was holy only by Divine Inſtitution and ſeparation to Gods Service, which otherwiſe had bin no more holy than another place.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, A <hi>Relative</hi> holineſs (or what may be ſo called) was all that could be attributed to the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, for it was holy, only in relation to thoſe holy uſes it was ſet apart for, and thoſe holy Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Priviledges, and manifeſtations of God,
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:45718:187"/>which were there to be enjoyed, only becauſe it was by Gods appointment ſeparated from all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon uſes, at all times, and appointed to relate wholly, and only to the ſervice of God, therefore we call it <hi>Ceremonially</hi> Holy. As it were matter of meer Ceremony to bow towards a Chair of State, as well when it is empty, as when the King is in it. So if our Churches ought alwayes to be uſed with the ſame Reverence, and Sequeſtration from all things of a Secular nature, when the ſervice of God is not actually performing there, as when it is, then were they Ceremonially holy, but it is not ſo, as I have ſhewed, therefore in the caſe of our Churches, what was ſaid of the Altar may be inverted, <hi>viz.</hi> it was ſaid of old that <hi>the Altar did ſanctify the Gift;</hi> but in this caſe, the <hi>Gift</hi> ſanctifieth the Altar, that is to ſay, the holineſs of our Churches being nothing elſe, but their relation to holy things, when thoſe holy things are not preſent, when no Ordinance is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtring, for that time they may be put to other uſes, becauſe the ſpecial preſence of God in our Churches, is only then, when his Name is there Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded, and his people met together in his Name; whereas God was alwaies ſpecially preſent in the Temple, by the viſible manifeſtations of his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, as namely, by the Cloud in which he dwelt, &amp;c. Our Churches do relate to as holy things, and as holy Ordinances, as the Temple did, only thoſe holy things are not ſo conſtantly in it, as was the preſence of God in that Temple, where he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly dwelt.</p>
            <p>I have beaten out this notion, to let you ſee that there is no ſuch great odds betwixt the Temple at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and other places built for the ſervice of God (neither of them being <hi>morally</hi> holy, and both of them being <hi>relatively holy,</hi> only the Temple was
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:45718:187"/>ſo continually, and our Churches are ſo but <hi>pro die &amp; nunc,</hi> or during the time of Religious adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions) I ſay the odds between them is not ſo great, but that an Argument may very well be drawn from Gods approbation of what was intended by <hi>David,</hi> and done by <hi>Solomon</hi> towards the building of that Temple, to evince what acceptance they are like to meet with, who for ſincere aims and ends, do, or ſhall contribute their aſſiſtance to the building of Churches.</p>
            <p>I could eaſily multiply reaſons why, though it is good to draw nigh to God any where, and to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip him though it were in <hi>Mountains, and dens, and Caves of the Earth,</hi> as the Primitive Chriſtians were forced to do, yet it is moſt expedient, and of great uſe, that publick places, ſuch as thoſe we call Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, ſhould be erected for the Worſhip and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God. For firſt of all, no man knows how ſoon the door may be ſhut againſt the exerciſe of Religion in any private place, I mean by them that firſt opened it, or by thoſe that ſhall come after them. Where Religion dwels but <hi>precatiouſly,</hi> or upon meer ſufferance (and not by the ſanction of Law) it may ſoon be caſt out (like <hi>Agar</hi> and her ſon) becauſe there ſhe is not Miſtreſs, ſhe cannot call the houſe her own. If the Landlord, or Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lords ſhall take pet at any thing, then out ſhe muſt, and ſo be hunted from place to place, as often as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence is taken, which to take, is the commoneſt thing in the world.</p>
            <p>I am miſtaken if private and ſmall Aſſemblies will not neceſſarily multiply <hi>in infinitum,</hi> if places for publick Worſhip be not built. If a great Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily were crowded into a houſe, in which every room were very ſmall (like Cabins in a ſhip) it were impoſſible that whole Family ſhould eat, and
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:45718:188"/>drink, and converſe all together, but every one muſt eat and drink by himſelf, or only ſome few in a company, which would be very uncomfortable, and a great diſorder.</p>
            <p>Some may think that the variety of Opinions which are in <hi>England</hi> at this day, would cauſe as great multiplicity of Aſſemblies as now is, though there were ever ſo many publick Churches: but I am not of their mind, for that I have taken notice, that where men of good lives, and of good abilities, have Preached, the Congregation hath conſiſted of ſober perſons, of very different perſwaſions, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out of a reſpect to publick Ordinances, have there preſented themſelves, though it may be ſcarce two of them of a different ſort, are ordinarily found to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether at the ſame private Meeting. I do not at all deſpair, but that ſome little prejudices which now keep good men aſunder, will in time wear off, and that (with the bleſſing of God) what I have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in this book, will ſomewhat contribute to it, or they themſelves, by degrees, will ſee the vanity, groundleſneſs, and ill conſequence of their diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and when that is done, one Church will hold them, whom now a few cannot.</p>
            <p>The inconvenience and ill conſequence of having many diviſions, and ſub-diviſions of Chriſtian So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties, more than is needful, or than uſe to be, is greater than can eaſily be foreſeen. If one and the ſame Church or Society break into ten, or twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty diſtinct Churches, or Societies, every one of them under ſeveral Teachers, and going their own way, will they not have leſs love for one another, leſs converſe together, leſs of Majeſty and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, leſs ſtrength and power to withſtand thoſe that ſhall oppoſe and ſet themſelves againſt them, than they had when they were all together? Who had
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:45718:188"/>not rather have any thing whole than in ſmall pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces? who will give ſo much for parcels, and rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, as for that cloth, or ſtuff, which is cut out of the whole piece? Bread that is cut, drieth and ſpoils preſently, and they ſay that beer drinks ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, and dies ſooner, when there is but a little of it, than when a great quantity is put up together. Should an army be divided into as many regiments, as there are companies in it, and into as many companies, as there are ſquadrons, it would be nothing like ſo able to deal with an enemy, nor would it be half ſo capable, as now it is, of good government, and diſcipline.</p>
            <p>Surely a good government in the Church were better than none at all; nor can the Church well ſubſiſt without ſome government, any more than a State can do: but certainly the Church can at no time admit of any government, either of one ſort, or of another, in caſe it were ſo, there were no publick Churches, or publick congregations: for if it happen there be ten, or twenty ſocieties, for one that uſe to be, that have no relation to one another, nor no certain places of meeting, who can take an account of them, or have a due inſpection over them? If a maſter that hath two hundred ſcholars, ſhould divide them into fifty ſeveral forms, or <hi>Claſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> reading diſtinct Authors, how impoſſible would it be for him to teach them all? whereas if he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce them all to five or ſix forms, with the help of an uſher, or two, he may teach them well enough.</p>
            <p>Let there be no government in the Church and then all will be Prophets, all will be teachers, or as many as pleaſe to make themſelves ſo, and as can gain a few people to hear them, the people will make to themſelves <hi>Prophets of the loweſt of the people, as did Jeroboam:</hi> (now it is a great evil to make teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:45718:189"/>of them that are none, as well as to make no teachers of them that are, or ought to be ſuch) and they that preach will preach what they liſt, none controlling them) and practiſe how they liſt and the end of that will be woful ignorance, error, diſſention and confuſion, which cannot be prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, unleſs the Church (that great ſchool of Chriſt) do conſiſt of larg forms or <hi>Claſſes,</hi> I mean publick Churches and congregations, to which the <hi>maſters of aſſemblies</hi> may have an eye, be thoſe maſters of aſſemblies of one judgment, or of another. If ſcholars repair to their ſchools at ſchool time, and there receive the inſtruction of honeſt and able maſters, (if it be their happineſs to have ſuch) they may better be truſted as to what they ſhal do at other hours, either in their cloſets or chambers, when they are by themſelves, or in company, and conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation one with another.</p>
            <p>Publick Churches will make way for Chriſtians to teſtifie their union, and communion with one another, by joyning there together (whatſoever opportunities over and above thoſe, they ſhall make uſe of in private.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Solomon</hi> tels us, that <hi>the borrower is ſervant to the lender,</hi> Prov. 22.7. If there be publick places e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, primarily, for religious worſhip, then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion will be in a condition to lend: (as when Churches are lent, at ſuch times as they can be ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, to ſuch as teach ſchool, and cannot be otherwiſe provided) but if there be no ſuch, Religion muſt borrow, and ſo become a ſervant, which ought to be every ones maſter.</p>
            <p>Private places of worſhip frequented by thoſe who altogether refrain the publick, are ordinarily called by ſome name of diſtinction, and appropria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as namely the place where the <hi>Quakers</hi> meet,
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:45718:189"/>or the <hi>Anabaptiſts meeting-houſe,</hi> or ſuch like, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as publick Churches carry no ſuch names of diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction with them, nor pretend to any other, than to keep open houſe for all comers, that have a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to wait upon God, in his ordinances, (be they of twenty ſeveral judgments) and that methinks is much better: for till names of diſtinction ceaſe diviſions will continue, and I ſee no reaſon why they who agree in the fundamental doctrines, and practiſes of Chriſtianity, ſhould not be willing to pray and hear, and ſing Pſalms together, (where thoſe duties are piouſly and ſolemnly performed) though they differ about twenty little things. Even infidels ſhould be admitted to publick prayer, and preaching, how elſe ſhould they believe in him of whom they have not heard? or how ſhould they be converted? and as for thoſe who in the judgment of charity are true believers though varying from us, in ſome ſmall opinions, and practiſes, I know not why we ſhould exclude them from fellowſhip with us in the Lords Supper, which is to raile in the Communion Table in the worſt of ſenſes.</p>
            <p>To have no publick Churches would carry ſuch a face with it, as if no Religion were owned, eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed, and countenanced, or any thing more than tollerated, and connived at (like a tollerable evil, rather than an indiſpenſable good) or rather as if all Religion were perſecuted, and driven into corners.</p>
            <p>If Religion be exerciſed only in private places, vice hath as much liberty as that comes to: drunkenneſs, and whoredom take their freedom in private houſes, and ſhall Religion appear no more publickly than they? as if it alſo were a work of darkneſs, and aſhamed to ſhew it's head.</p>
            <p>If I thought that all the reaſons I have alledged, would not prevail with men of eſtates to contribute
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:45718:190"/>freely towards the building of Churches: I could upbraid them, by telling them that which is no news (for were it news I would not tell it them,) <hi>viz.</hi> that ſeveral places of good capacity, have been erected by a ſort of people that are generally none of the richeſt, and who when they did it, had cauſe to fear leaſt ſome creature or other, would cauſe their ground to wither, and expoſe them to the ſcorching Sun. I ſay ſome perſons have adventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red under thoſe perillous circumſtances, to build larg places for the exerciſe of their Religion, all their diſcouragements notwithſtanding: if then the people who are richer than they, who have leave and incouragement, to build publick Churches, and may have many thanks for their labour, who have the law of the land on their ſide, and all the power of the nation divided amongſt them, whoſe Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches are as like to ſtand as the City it ſelf is, or will be, when rebuilt; I ſay if they have not ſo much love for the nation, for themſelves, and for Religion, as to build us more <hi>Synagogues</hi> in lieu of thoſe that were burnt, the <hi>Chappels of eaſe</hi> I ſpake of, or <hi>ſhrines</hi> (what ſhall I call them) will riſe up in judgment againſt you.</p>
            <p>If you will not build publick Churches, who are like to have the greateſt intereſt in them, when they are built, I was about to ſay thoſe poor people I mentioned but now, (as hardly as they are thought of) would (I am perſwaded ſpare money from their backs and bellies, to build more Churches, if they might be ſure they ſhould be theirs, as much as yours when they are built again: nay, be it how it will be, ſuch is the love, the ſoberer ſort of them do bear to publick ordinances, that I queſtion not but they will bear their full proportion; when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever trial ſhall be made, what every man will
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:45718:190"/>freely contribute to the building of publick Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. If thoſe that ſpeak little of the Church, ſhould do more for it than ſome that have the <hi>Church,</hi> the <hi>Church,</hi> ever in their mouths (as the Jews of old, <hi>the Temple of the Lord, the Temple of the Lord,</hi> Jer. 7.4.) it would be a woful ſhame.</p>
            <p>But why ſhould I ſeem to miſtruſt, or doubt of the piety, and bounty, of the true ſons and daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the Church, towards their diſtreſſed mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? who hath not heard of that noble Lady (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther now living, or dead I know not) who out of her own eſtate hath given ſome thouſands of pounds towards the rebuilding, of the Church of S. <hi>Dunſtans in the Eaſt,</hi> (now in a good forwardneſs) and of what the liberal Miniſter of that place, is ſaid him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to have given towards that good work? even more than many good Miniſters have in all the world. Their zeal (I hope) will provoke many. I hope it will, and I do earneſtly deſire it may: for a ſad <hi>climax</hi> runs in my thoughts, and I am much perſwaded if it ſhould come to be tried, it would prove to true, <hi>viz.</hi> no publick Churches, no legal maintenance; no legal maintenance, in time no able Miniſters, (for who will ſtudy to be ſtarved?) no good miniſtry, no good preaching, no good preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, no converſion, no converſion, no ſalvation.

            <p>I am loath to ſay that the rebuilding of Churches in <hi>London,</hi> if it be not done by voluntary contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and by way of free-will offerings, it will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly be done by conſtraint, and compulſion from authority: and if authority be forced to interpoſe, in a matter of this nature, it will be no ſmall ſhame and reproach to us, and ſeem to ſignifie that we would not be religious but upon force, which is to be no more religious, than they may be ſaid to be honeſt, who never pay their creditors, but when they ſtrain upon them (or make diſtreſs) which is indeed for creditors to pay themſelves.</p>
            <p>Time was when the bounty of men towards the Church was ſuch, and ſo great, that Laws were made to limit, and reſtrain it, for that men were ready to ſay to <hi>a father</hi> or to <hi>a mother,</hi> as the <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees</hi> did, <hi>Mat.</hi> 15.5. <hi>It is a gift, (Corban) viz.</hi> to the Church <hi>by whatſoever thou mighteſt be profited by me:</hi> and we find <hi>Moſes</hi> was fain to ſet bounds to the ſea of the peoples liberality towards the taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle in his time, ſaying hitherto ſhould it go, and no farther, <hi>Exod.</hi> 36.5. <hi>And they ſpake unto Moſes ſaying, the people bring much more than enough, and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes gave commandment, and they cauſed it to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed throughout the camp ſaying, let neither man nor woman make any more work, for the offering of the ſanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary, ſo the people were reſtrained from bringing.</hi> I wiſh that at this day there were an overplus of liberal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity towards the demoliſhed Churches, I mean more contributed, than would ſerve to rebuild them, that like as the oinment which was poured upon the head of <hi>Aaron</hi> ran down upon his beard, and upon the skirts of his garment, ſo that what is more than enough for the re-edifying of Churches, might go to the rebuilding of <hi>Hoſpitals,</hi> and publick

            <p>
               <hi>England hath done wickedneſs as it could,</hi> that is, with all its might. Profanneſs is come in upon us like a flood: men glory now a daies in their ſhame, and ſeem aſhamed of that wherein they ſhould glory.

            <p>I could proceed to higher things, and ſay, we have learnt to bring ſerious preaching, and preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers upon the ſtage, and to bring ſome thing like ſtage-plaiers, now and then into the pulpit.

               </p>
            </argument>
            <p>OUr bodies are houſes that muſt be demoliſhed, and it is as probable by fire, as any how: for feavers are a kind of fire, and they deſtroy a great, if not the greateſt part of mankind. Howſoever <hi>duſt they are, and to duſt they muſt return.</hi> Yet ſo ſurely as they ſhall fall, ſo certain it is that they ſhall riſe again; <hi>there ſhall be a reſurrection of the dead, both of thoſe juſt and unjuſt,</hi> Acts 24.15.</p>
            <p>I doubt not of the poſſibility of a <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> ſith I am ſure of the truth of a <hi>Creation,</hi> and to raiſe the bodies of men out of duſt, is not of more dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty, than to raiſe a world out of a <hi>Chaos,</hi> and that <hi>Chaos</hi> out of nothing.</p>
            <p>To ſay though ſuch a thing as a <hi>Reſurrection</hi> be poſſible, yet it ſhall never be, were to deny that principle which is common to moſt Religions in the world, and which is the main foundation they are built upon, <hi>viz.</hi> the doctrine of a future eſtate, or of a life after this.</p>
            <p>Chriſt told the <hi>Jewes,</hi> that <hi>if they deſtroyed the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of his body, he would raiſe it up again in three daies,</hi> and ſo he did, and that he did ſo, I ſay the evidence, and aſſurance we have that he did do ſo, is the great prop and pillar of our Chriſtian faith: therefore the ſcripture ſaith of Chriſt, that he was <hi>declared to be the ſon of God with power, by the reſurrection from the dead,</hi> Rom. 1.4. If Chriſt had not riſen again the third day (according to his promiſe) his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples had certainly renounced all confidence in
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:45718:196"/>him, and taken him for an impoſtor, and not for the Son of God, and Saviour of the world: but we are well aſſured that both they, and many hundreds of others, who lived about the ſame time, or not long after them, did ſtrenuouſly aſſert that Chriſt did riſe from the dead, and did ſeal that truth with their blood, that being the main article againſt them, that they did ſo believe: as S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Act.</hi> 13.6. <hi>Of the hope and reſurrection of the dead, I am <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="366" facs="tcp:45718:197"/>words, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.35.) I anſwer, that it doth not appear that the houſes of wicked men, (their bodies I mean) ſhall be any thing more beautiful, at the <hi>reſurrection</hi> than they were before, or freed from thoſe deformities which they carried to the grave with them, (but <hi>as thoſe trees fall, ſo</hi> they ſhall riſe) or if they ſhould, what would it ſignifie? when neither they, nor others could ſee it for want of light? Did goodly houſes, or Churches, look beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully, in the midſt of flames? when nothing but the wall of fire, that was round about them could be ſeen? but ſure I am, the houſes of good men (that is their bodies) ſhall all, and every of them be beautified at the <hi>reſurrection,</hi> and whereas ſome of them were like houſes that are low built, others like rooms that are ſhelving (or garret-wiſe,) others dark, like dungeons, others ſlight and thin, like paper-walled houſes, thoſe and all other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences, ſhall be removed, for then <hi>ſhall their vile bodies, be changed, and faſhioned like unto Chriſt his glorious body according to the working whereby he is able to ſubdue all things to himſelf,</hi> Phil. 3.21.</p>
            <p>Now the ſouls of men go about like ſnails, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying their ſhels upon their backs, (which maketh their motion ſlow) but their houſes, or bodies, after the <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> ſhall be no more clogs, or impediments to their ſouls, than wings are to the flight of birds.</p>
            <p>Here our earthly houſes (that is our bodies) do ſoil, and ſtain the ſouls that inhabit them, as the bare walls of new buildings, uſe to do the garments of thoſe that dwell in them, but at the reſurrection they ſhall no more do that, than thoſe rooms de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>file our cloaths, which are hung with the neweſt, and neateſt tapiſtry. Thoſe houſes which have no filthineſs in themſelves (and ſuch will our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:45718:197"/>then be) can convey none to others.</p>
            <p>How glad would the wicked be that theſe their houſes of clay might never be rebuilt? how much rather could they wiſh they might be annihilated? For in theſe very houſes muſt they <hi>dwell with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming fire, and everlaſting burnings.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Conſider the bodies of good men as <hi>the Temple of God</hi> (for ſo they are called, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.16.) and as the members of Chriſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.15. <hi>Know ye not that your bodies are the members of Chriſt?</hi> conſider them <hi>as ſleeping in Jeſus,</hi> for ſo the expreſſion is 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.14. (as if the boſome of Chriſt were the <hi>Urne</hi> in which thoſe aſhes were laid up) I ſay con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider them under that threefold notion, and you will ſee no cauſe to wonder, that ſo much care ſhould be taken of thoſe demoliſhed Temples, as to rebuild them, of thoſe loſt members, as to reſtore them, and of thoſe ſcattered aſhes, and diſperſed duſt, as to gather them together again.</p>
            <p>Moſt houſes of note (as publick Halls, &amp;c.) and wherein perſons of conſiderable quality were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, that were lately burnt down, are like to be built again, and the owners thereof do think, that in point of honour, they can do no leſs, and ſhall not the <hi>Temples of God,</hi> which are the bodies of his Saints, I ſay, ſhall not they be rebuilt? is it not for the honour of the great God that it ſhould be ſo?</p>

            <p>It is a conſideration which may greatly comfort good men, that at the <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> they ſhall not only have better houſes then ever they had before, but thoſe houſes ſhall have far better inhabitants than they formerly had, even <hi>the Souls of juſt men made perfect,</hi> whereas their former houſes were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited by the Souls (though of juſt men) yet full of imperfections. It will then be their happineſs to have <hi>Sanam mentem in corpore Sano,</hi> Souls and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies proſpering both alike.</p>
            <p>What troubleſome houſes are our preſent bodies which need repairing every day by meat and drink, and every night by reſt and ſleep; which are in continual danger of being thrown down by one means, and by another; but thoſe new houſes, (or bodies) which believers ſhall enter into at the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection,</hi> will need no meats or drinks, wherewith to repair them, for then ſhall they be <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, that is, <hi>as the Angels of God,</hi> Mat. 22.30. ſhall be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to no element (whether fire or water) or to any other creature, ſhall be uncapable of being deſtroyed for <hi>they ſhall be raiſed incorruptible,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.52. and <hi>Luk.</hi> 20.36. <hi>Neither can they dye any more.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How ſtrange is it then that we ſhould read of any <hi>which ſhall be accounted worthy to obtain that world, and that reſurrection from the dead,</hi> the ſtate of the <hi>reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection</hi> being ſo glorious as it is? well may it be ſaid <hi>they are children of God being the children of the
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:45718:199"/>reſurrection,</hi> for ſo the better <hi>reſurrection</hi> is called, <hi>the reſurrection,</hi> by way of eminency, though beſides the <hi>reſurrection of life,</hi> there is alſo <hi>a reſurrection of condemnation,</hi> John 5.29.</p>
            <p>Two extreams there are which may prejudice the Doctrine of the <hi>Reſurrection;</hi> One is a vein of <hi>allegoriſing</hi> every thing. We read of ſome <hi>who erred ſaying, The Reſurrection is paſt already,</hi> 2 Tim. 2.18. and they muſt needs be ſuch as took the <hi>Reſurrection</hi> for ſome other thing than the raiſing of all men from the dead, <hi>viz.</hi> in ſome myſtical ſenſe. Others will allow of no figurative expreſſions, and ſuch, if you tell them of a <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> may (according to their Principles) tell you that Chriſt is the only <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection,</hi> becauſe of what is ſaid <hi>John.</hi> 11.25. <hi>I am the Reſurrection</hi> (meaning cauſally &amp;c.)</p>
            <p>But whilſt we ſpeak of the ra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſing or rebuilding of our bodies, O the admirable power and wiſdom of God, that is able to build with ſuch Materials, ſome part whereof muſt be fetcht out of the bottom of the Sea, other parts out of the bowells of living Creatures, out of the entrails of Worms and Fiſhes (and ſuch like) which have fed upon them.</p>
            <p>Who but he that is omniſcient, could tell where to find that broken, ſcattered, and diſperſed ſtuff, wherewith the bodies of men ſhall be rebuilt? or if they knew where it were, who but he (<hi>whoſe Arm is not</hi> to <hi>ſhort</hi> for any purpoſe) were able to come at it? Where is that Artificer that can diſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt duſt and duſt? the duſt of one houſe and of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, if the duſt of twenty houſes were mixed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether and laid in one heap? or who can build a houſe of meer duſt? I ſay, who but the great God can do either of theſe? and he will do both.</p>
            <p>Neither is the <hi>condeſcenſion</hi> of God, appearing in
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:45718:200"/>the <hi>Reſurrection</hi> of his ſervants, leſs admirable than are the demonſtrations of his power and wiſdom, in that he ſheweth himſelf mindful of his people, in the loweſt condition they can be in, even when he hath <hi>brought them into the duſt of death,</hi> as the phraſe is, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22.15.</p>
            <p>The peculiar reſpects which God beareth to them that fear him, will be moſt conſpicuous at the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection,</hi> for then the houſes of his ſervants ſhall overtop the houſes of all wicked men, <hi>the Mountain of their houſes ſhall be eſtabliſhed in the top of the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, and ſhall be exalted above the Hills</hi> of others (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luding to <hi>Iſa.</hi> 2.2.) <hi>For the upright ſhall have dominion over the wicked in the morning,</hi> Pſal. 49.14.</p>
            <p>I can but think how the Souls of juſt men, when they have put off theſe earthly Tabernacles, will long to be poſſeſſed of their new houſes, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.23. <hi>We our ſelves groan, waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body:</hi> And well then may we long for that time, conſidering that he who hath called the bodies of his Saints <hi>the Temples of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> 1 Cor. 6.19. will be much more graciouſly and viſibly preſent in thoſe Temples ſo refined, as they will be at the <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> than in thoſe we carry about with us, ſo defiled and polluted as they are at the preſent.</p>
            <p>It is the leaſt thing I can ſay of the <hi>Reſurrection of the juſt,</hi> that when that time ſhall come, all their defects, and deformities of body ſhall then be done away for ever; and yet what would not ſome men give to be cured of one bodily defect? be it blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or deafneſs, or lameneſs, and to be reſtored to any limb or ſenſe they want but for that little time they have to live? But alas how many defects and deformities are there which no Art of man can
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:45718:200"/>cure? To ſuch as labour under any of them, I would ſay, Have patience but a little while, get part in <hi>the firſt Reſurrection,</hi> that you may have intereſt in the ſecond, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Reſurrection of life,</hi> lay up a good Foundation for the time to come <hi>that thou mayeſt be recompenſed at the Reſurrection of the juſt,</hi> Luke 14.14. Make ſhift for the preſent; for a ſhort ſeaſon, a ſorry houſe may ſerve the turn, when death and the Grave, which muſt ſwallow thee down for a while, ſhall deliver thee up again (as the Whale did <hi>Jonah</hi>) thy next houſe ſhall be a Pallace, that is, the body which thou ſhalt receive at the <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> or which thou ſhalt riſe with, ſhall be as free from defects, and deformities, as is the glorious body of Chriſt himſelf.</p>
            <p>I cannot ſufficiently admire the happineſs of thoſe perſons who live under the ſtrong and comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table expectations of a <hi>better Reſurrection,</hi> Heb. 11.35. that is, of a better condition after death, than ever they had before it. Lord fill my ſoul, and the Souls of all thy children, with that bleſſed expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and do thou inable me and them to ſay, with thy holy Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> and thoſe whom he there joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth with himſelf, <hi>We know that if our earthly houſe of this Tabernacle were diſſolved, we have a building of God, a houſe not made with hands, eternal in the Heavens,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.1.</p>
